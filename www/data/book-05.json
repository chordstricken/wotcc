Elyas, a former Warder who found he could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in himself.

The two are now married. Perrin is a very large man&#x2014;he was always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got out of hand. His size helps considerably when helping Master Luhhan on his forge, but sometimes gives others the impression that he is slow and stupid. He is currently in the Two Rivers, helping to rebuild the area after the series of Trolloc attacks.",
