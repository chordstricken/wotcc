Aviendha is one of the three women in <a href='#Min'>Min<\/a>&apos;s viewing of Rand&#x2014;she also saw that she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings in Rhuidean. She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became unavailable and she tried bathing as &#x201C;wetlanders&#x201D; did; Rand came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she panicked. She created a Traveling gateway to southern Seanchan (she does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible, into the middle of winter. When Rand rescued her, she decided she could not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the night in each other&apos;s arms before coming back. Aviendha says a similar incident will not occur, and punished any Maiden who made a crack about it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of the world on another continent is a different subject entirely). She felt <i>toh<\/i> toward <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne<\/a> for violating her trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once again. She is not certain what she thinks of a <i>second<\/i> sister-wife in Min, but she seems to accept the idea at least. She has been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way. She has, however, mastered the art of untying weaves&#x2014;a feat which was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken. She and Elayne have adopted each other as first-sisters. Aviendha has a special ability in making wards against eavesdropping; it is unlikely even the Forsaken could breach one of her wards, and certainly no one could do so without her knowing it immediately. Aviendha was staying with Elayne at the Royal Palace in Caemlyn, but she was summoned away by the Wise Ones to complete her training. While in the Palace, she discovered a new Talent: the ability to sense the function of a <i>ter&apos;angreal<\/i> simply by holding it in her hands.

Despite being made of <i>cuendillar<\/i>, the three that remain unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a fall from a table. The Dark One is also referred to by other euphemisms, including Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Father of Lies, Grassburner, Leafblighter, Heartfang, Heartsbane, Soulsbane, Lord of the Twilight, Father of Storms, Shepherd of the Night, Soulblinder, and (among Darkfriends) the Great Lord of the Dark.",

                "info": "Young woman from Emond&apos;s Field and daughter of the innkeeper there, now raised to the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat<\/a> among the Aes Sedai opposing <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida<\/a>. She has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years. She is also the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent. Before her time with the Wise Ones, she was sold by <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin<\/a> to <a href='#Suroth'>Suroth<\/a> to be made <i>damane<\/i>. She was held captive under the name Tuli under care of the <i>sul&apos;dam<\/i> <a href='#Renna'>Renna Emain<\/a>. When Egwene escaped, she left Renna with her <i>a&apos;dam<\/i> in place; the fact that Renna was bound by the <i>a&apos;dam<\/i> threatens to destroy the foundation of Seanchan society, especially their enslavement of women who can channel. Egwene is good friends with <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne Trakand<\/a>, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend of <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a>, the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a>. In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get married, and do not want to. Egwene is the love object of both of Elayne&apos;s brothers, <a href='#Galad'>Galad<\/a> and <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn<\/a>&#x2014;she is flattered by Galad&apos;s attentions, but she does not return them. She does find Gawyn to her liking, and had a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur. Egwene was most likely chosen Amyrlin because she was in the Aiel Waste when the rebellion occurred, and because the Aes Sedai thought she could be manipulated by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent, they made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the strongest Amyrlins in history. Egwene has enlisted <a href='#Bryne'>Gareth Bryne<\/a> as the commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida<\/a> from power. She has also opened the novice books to all interested women for the first time in history&#x2014;in the past, they were only open to girls of a certain age, for fear that older women would not be able to handle the discipline. This policy has increased the size of the rebel Tower to several times the size of the original, unified one. The number of novices has increased to levels not known for over a thousand years. Egwene has also discovered many lost Talents of the Age of Legends, such as Dreaming, Traveling, and the making of <i>cuendillar<\/i>. She was guided to Dreaming by the Wise Ones, with whom she studied in the Aiel Waste, and was guided to the making of <i>cuendillar<\/i> by <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien<\/a> while she was captured, but Traveling was her discovery alone. She has recovered some other abilities through Moghedien as well. She plans to reunite the Tower and make it stronger than ever&#x2014;and she plans to start by exiling Elaida, as she will not unite the Tower, only shatter it into fragments that will never be gathered up again. Egwene was captured by sisters loyal to Elaida after executing her plan to block the harbor by turning the harbor chain to <i>cuendillar<\/i>. She is now a prisoner in the Tower, and has been re-enlisted as a Novice again. She accepts all punishments Elaida and others impose upon her for insisting that she is still the Amyrlin Seat and still Aes Sedai. Her strong will and persistence have earned her the respect of nearly all the novices and perhaps several of the Accepted as well. Egwene plans to subvert Elaida from the inside by making suggestions and hinting that various things Elaida has done are indefinsible; she speaks to anyone that seems willing to ponder those suggestions. More urgently, Egwene is attempting to convince the Hall&#x2014;both the Hall in Tar Valon and the Hall in Exile&#x2014;that they must be prepared for the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent.",

                "info": "Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat<\/a> in Tar Valon. She was born the youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy. She occasionally has the Foretelling, and as a result of a Foretelling she had concerning the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon Gaidon, she served as advisor to <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase<\/a> of Andor for her entire reign. She later led the coup that deposed <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a> and placed herself on the Amyrlin Seat in Siuan&apos;s place. She distrusts anyone not of the Red Ajah (as most Reds do), and does not think she will ever be able to trust any member of the Blue Ajah again. Her <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles<\/a> was <a href='#Alviarin'>Alviarin Freidhen<\/a> of the White Ajah&#x2014;she was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of Siuan. If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <i>she<\/i> would have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan. Her Foretelling about the importance of Andor&apos;s royal family during the Last Battle occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne. Another of her Foretellings was to predict that <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a> would shake the world on its very foundations&#x2014;she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about him when he was right in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time. Her most recent Foretelling was that &#x201C;the White Tower would be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever. <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a> will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds.&#x201D; The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly accurate. However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida&apos;s Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain. It may have meant Morgase, <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn<\/a>, <a href='#Galad'>Galad<\/a>, and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne<\/a> (they have all had a large role to play in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old Royal Family, that of <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine<\/a>, <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail<\/a>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well. After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a>. Her most recent Foretelling will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be; she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her. Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan (before she was still and Healed), <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine<\/a>, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne<\/a>, <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve<\/a>, and a few others could match her strength. Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last Battle, and tried to capture Rand al&apos;Thor in an effort to gain similar control. The only sisters that support her are those that are actually Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually <i>did<\/i> shatter). Elaida is currently building a palace for herself atop the Warders&apos; old practice yard. The building will be about as tall as the White Tower. She has no plans on being merciful on those who rebelled against her when she deposed Siuan&#x2014;her terms are that the Blue Ajah no longer exists, and that any sister following Egwene must serve penance under her personal guidance before being readmitted to the Tower. Elaida has since replaced Alviarin as Keeper with a sister of the Red Ajah, Tarna Feir, and she has suspicions that Alviarin was trying to commit treason against the Tower. She ordered <a href='#Seaine'>Seaine Herimon<\/a> to &#x201C;follow the trail of treason&#x201D; as far as it went, even to the Keeper herself. Seaine interpreted this as a charge to capture members of the Black Ajah, leading to a grave situation for Seaine, as she now has several Black sisters that she has uncovered and no longer feels she can trust Elaida.",

She is the daughter of <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase<\/a> and her late husband, <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail Damodred<\/a>, and sister to <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn<\/a>. She is also half-sister to <a href='#Galad'>Galad<\/a>, although she would rather not be reminded of this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not really like him.

She has red-gold curly hair. During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne realized she loved <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a>, and told him how she felt; he felt similarly. She had no idea at the time what <a href='#Min'>Min<\/a> meant about &#x201C;having to share him,&#x201D; but now knows about Min&apos;s viewing of Rand with the three women&apos;s heads, indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and Aviendha, and they with him. Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien<\/a>, Elayne ended up bonding Birgitte as her Warder (despite being only Accepted at the time) in order to save Birgitte&apos;s life. Elayne later went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a <i>ter&apos;angreal<\/i> that they used to fix the weather. She has since returned to Andor upon hearing news of her mother&apos;s disappearance; she plans to take the Lion Throne, as soon as she has garnered enough support to keep it. She recently ended Arymilla&apos;s campaign for the Throne, which convinced all but one of the necessary nobles to support her for the Lion Throne. During that campaign, Elayne was captured by the Black Ajah, though Birgitte convinced the Windfinders to help rescue her. In the mean time, Elayne has managed to reproduce several <i>ter&apos;angreal<\/i>, something which no one else has been able to do since the Breaking of the World, as well as discover a way to share a Warder bond between three women; she bonded Rand along with Aviendha, her new sister by Aiel tradition, and Min. Shortly after bonding Rand, she became pregnant with Rand&apos;s twins. To protect the children, she is not revealing the father of the twins. She is the first ruler of Andor to <i>ever<\/i> cede land to anyone: she agreed with the Sea Folk to cede a few square miles of Andor to them in exchange for their help feeding the city during the siege. She also sends Andoran troops to the Black Tower (which is on Andoran soil) periodically to remind its inhabitants that they are still within Andor and subject to its laws. She is proving to be a capable leader, one her people may eventually be quite proud of.",

She usually dressed in attire reserved for men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a miner. However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she began to wear more traditionally feminine attire&#x2014;still coat and trousers, but cut to emphasize female characteristics.

She has actually been of the Black Ajah for all but five of her almost ninety years wearing the shawl; she is of high standing among the Black sisters. Galina has long black hair without a touch of gray in it. She is pretty, but nowhere near beautiful. She led the expedition to bring <a href='#Rand'>Rand<\/a> to Tar Valon after he was shielded. She was captured by the Shaido after the battle at Dumai&apos;s Wells, and became a prisoner of <a href='#Sevanna'>Sevanna<\/a> and Therava. She claims to have helped break two <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin<\/a>&apos;s as a Black sister&#x2014;one (<a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a>) was deposed and stilled, and the other (<a href='#Tamra'>Tamra Ospenya<\/a>) was made to appear that she had died in her sleep. She led the circle that stilled Siuan. <a href='#Pevara'>Pevara<\/a> firmly did not want to believe that Galina was Black, despite <a href='#Talene'>Talene<\/a>&apos;s suspicions that she was. When Galina&apos;s loyalties were proven, presumably by an inconsistency between her notes and her actions, Pevara went into a rage for a full day and now vows to strangle Galina with her bare hands. Galina attempted to escape Sevanna&apos;s captivity by exploiting a loophole in the oath she was forced to swear on a binder (similar to the Oath Rod): she made <a href='#Faile'>Faile<\/a> acquire the rod for her and give it to her (since she was forced to swear an oath to never steal it) and then betrayed Faile and fled. She was captured by Therava and ordered never to attempt to escape again; by her Oath, she is now Therava&apos;s slave forever. The White Tower presumes her to be dead at the battle of Dumai&apos;s Wells. She was on <a href='#Verin'>Verin<\/a>&apos;s list of sisters of the Black Ajah.",

He was appointed to the position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was exiled from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase&apos;s new advisor, <a href='#Gaebril'>Lord Gaebril<\/a>. He moved to his private estates in rural Andor, where he later presided over the trial of three young women who unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a>, the former <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat<\/a>; <a href='#Leane'>Leane Sharif<\/a>, the former <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles<\/a>, and <a href='#Min'>Min Farshaw<\/a>. When these three made an oath to serve him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer curiosity to Salidar. Once there, he discovered the true identity of the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken. The Aes Sedai in Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the Amyrlin Seat from <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida<\/a>, since he was the only commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help them. He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel Waste, in a league with Pedron Niall, <a href='#Rodel'>Rodel Ituralde<\/a>, <a href='#Bashere'>Davram Bashere<\/a>, Agelmar Jagad, and <a href='#Mat'>Matrim Cauthon<\/a>. Although neither of them would admit it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to avoid another mistake like his relationship as <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase<\/a>&apos;s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for when she publicly shamed him years ago. She seems to be developing similar feelings for him, much to her dismay. He plans to be the first general to take the city of Tar Valon; the closest anyone else has ever come was with Guaire Amalasan&apos;s armies, who got as far as the White Tower itself, and <a href='#Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing<\/a>, who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city. Actually, Amalasan&apos;s troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships coming up the river. Bryne thought he would be able to overcome this problem by purchasing ships along the way to Tar Valon, but when <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a> brought the entire army to Tar Valon by Traveling, that plan faltered; instead, he pressured her to let him use gateways to breach the walls and get inside the city. He is stocky, with a bluff face. The years have given him some sort of comforting calmness. Men always follow him&#x2014;they have learned from history that doing so is the path to military victory. Bryne taught <a href='#Galad'>Galad<\/a> and <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn<\/a> to practice the sword with both hands alternating to avoid weakness. Bryne is currently besieging the city of Tar Valon.",

Along with his good friends, <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara<\/a>, he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after Winternight. On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protects him from women&apos;s channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat&apos;s <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i> qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games&#x2014;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including Eldrin and Bodewhin, who were 16 and 17, respectively, when Mat left Emond&apos;s Field. His father Abell is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World. Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&#x2014;his collection would surprise anyone. In the Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan. However, she was not the <a href='#9Moons'>Daughter of the Nine Moons<\/a>, who Mat is destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends. Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regretted it deeply. He also has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&#x2014;which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &#x201C;to die and live again.&#x201D; He created an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old Manetheren, and served in a way as Rand&apos;s personal general&#x2014;this worked well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even <a href='#Bashere'>Davram Bashere<\/a>, who has earned his reputation as one of the best commanders alive. Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a bath. Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne<\/a> and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve<\/a> and prevent them from getting themselves killed. While there, he was cornered by <a href='#Tylin'>Queen Tylin<\/a>, who gave him little choice but to become her lover. When the Sea Folk and the Seanchan did battle in the city, he made his escape, leaving Tylin tied up under the bed so it looked &#x201C;official&#x201D;&#x2014;Tylin was found torn limb from limb, obviously by the <i>gholam<\/i> which was no doubt sent to kill Mat. In the process of leaving, Mat also took several <i>sul&apos;dam<\/i> and <i>damane<\/i> (who were subsequently freed from their collars), and even kidnapped <a href='#Tuon'>Tuon<\/a>, the <a href='#9Moons'>Daughter of the Nine Moons<\/a> herself. Mat traveled with Valan Luca&apos;s show to keep out of Seanchan sight for quite some time. Tuon has now completed Mat&apos;s unwitting marriage ceremony; he is now among the highest of the Seanchan ruling class, despite his insistence that he will fight the Seanchan during any battle if such battle is necessary.",

Born of a noble House in Cairhien, she is <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail Damodred</a>&apos;s youngest half-sister, and <a href='#Laman'>King Laman</a>&apos;s niece. She is considered short among her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people. When it was discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai.

Moiraine and Siuan walked away from each other and did not speak to each other again (at least in public), but both held secret communication with each other and dedicated their lives to finding and guiding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>. Moiraine found the young man she sought on Winternight in Emond&apos;s Field, a young man named <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, along with two more <i>ta&apos;veren</i>, <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon</a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara</a>, and two women with the spark of the Power inborn, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere</a> and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve al&apos;Meara</a>. When Moiraine was shortly raised to the shawl, she met <a href='#Lan'>al&apos;Lan Mandragoran</a>, the uncrowned King of Malkier, who was fighting alone against the Shadow in the Borderlands; she eventually asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted. She is very strong in the Power, stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai before Egwene and Nynaeve came to the Tower. In the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken Be&apos;lal with balefire, just before he would have killed Rand. Later, after having an inkling of the future events from the testing <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to push the Forsaken <a href='#Lanfear'>Lanfear</a> through the twisted doorway <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both her and Lanfear there.

According to a letter Moiraine wrote to <a href='#Thom'>Thom Merrilin</a> the day before her death, however, she lives on in the land of the Finn, but her bond with Lan has been severed. The same letter convinced <a href='#Mat'>Mat</a> to help Thom rescue her, though her vision in the <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> apparently indicated disaster would result unless Mat <i>asked</i> to see the letter before Thom showed it to him. Other Aes Sedai consider Moiraine a legend, not only for discovering the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a> but for defeating two of the Forsaken as well.

Taringail was Elayne&apos;s and Gawyn&apos;s father; he died when they were young. Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including <a href='#Thom'>Thomdril Merrilin<\/a>, a former court-bard; <a href='#Bryne'>Gareth Bryne<\/a>, her First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Guards; and most recently <a href='#Gaebril'>Lord Gaebril<\/a>, a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase&apos;s trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne&apos;s whereabouts. Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power. The Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive. She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand.

When Morgase discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was actually <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin<\/a>) meant to usurp her throne, she left, and when she learned that the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a> had taken over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could: Pedron Niall and the Children of the Light. She was not aware that <a href='#Rand'>Rand<\/a> only wanted to give her country back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead. If she had made her presence known, she would no doubt have had her country back in one piece, but as royalty she believed she must work on her own and trust no one. She went into hiding after the Seanchan attack (<a href='#Valda'>Eamon Valda<\/a> believes her to be dead) under her mother&apos;s first name, Maighdin to avoid instant recognition, and later became a maidservant to <a href='#Faile'>Faile<\/a>; she told Faile that she was a lady&apos;s handmaid before coming into her service. When Faile&apos;s group was captured, she became a prisoner of the Shaido, and is now detained in their encampment. Her sign is three golden keys. A former member of the Queen&apos;s Guard, Martyn Tallanvor, has taken a liking to his former queen, and she finds herself almost unconsciously returning his attentions. Her adopted son <a href='#Galad'>Galad<\/a> believes her dead at the hands of Eamon Valda, and plans revenge on him.

Perrin was instrumental in freeing Rand from his entrapment at Dumai&apos;s Wells; the two had a fight afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to leave, although they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as it was), and Perrin went to Ghealdan to see if he could tame <a href='#Masema'>Masema<\/a>.

                "info": "Young man from Emond&apos;s Field in the Two Rivers, now proclaimed to be the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a>. He is very tall, with curly red-blond hair and bright blue-gray eyes that shine like gemstones. He was raised by <a href='#Tam'>Tam al&apos;Thor<\/a> and his wife Kari (until her death around the time Rand was five) in Emond&apos;s Field. His real parents, however, were <a href='#Janduin'>Janduin<\/a>, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish <a href='#Laman'>Laman<\/a>&apos;s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named Shaiel, who was actually <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine Damodred<\/a>, the runaway Daughter-Heir of Andor. Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy; &#x201C;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.&#x201D; Rand had a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael<\/a>. He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him as the <i><a href='#Caracarn'>Car&apos;a&apos;carn<\/a><\/i>, the Chief of Chiefs of the Aiel. He has recently taken to wearing a new sword: curved, with a black scabbard, painted with two twisting dragons much like those on his forearms. It was found under a submerged statue. He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also He Who Comes With the Dawn, the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and the <a href='#Coramoor'>Coramoor<\/a>, the one prophesied to bring the Sea Folk out of the Sea. He can channel strongly, more so than any person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul, <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon<\/a>, who was obviously of equal strength), and is also <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i>, the most strongly so since Lews Therin as well. Lews Therin&apos;s voice has somehow found a new place inside of Rand&apos;s head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of <i>saidin<\/i> from him. Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i> during his turing of the Wheel, two men born within days (hours, even) of him named <a href='#Mat'>Matrim Cauthon<\/a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara<\/a>, who both grew up in Emond&apos;s Field as well. Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has): <a href='#Min'>Min Farshaw<\/a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne Trakand<\/a>, and <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha<\/a>. Rand has had success in fighting many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped. He killed Aginor at the Eye of the World after the Green Man killed Balthamel; he allowed <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine<\/a> to kill Be&apos;lal in the Stone of Tear, and killed <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael<\/a> in the Stone shortly afterward; in the wagons near the Spine of the World, <a href='#Lanfear'>Lanfear<\/a> confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine; he killed <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin<\/a> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod<\/i> when he came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn; <a href='#Asmodean'>Asmodean<\/a>, his teacher, was killed shortly after Rahvin met his fate; <a href='#Sammael'>Sammael<\/a> met his fate while fighting Rand in Shadar Logoth at the hands of Mashadar; Osan&apos;gar, the reincarnation of Aginor, died at Shador Logoth when Rand was cleansing <i>saidin<\/i>; and <a href='#Semirhage'>Semirhage<\/a> was captured during her attempt to capture Rand and bind him with a male <i>a&apos;dam<\/i>. During his duel with Sammael, Rand encountered a mysterious wanderer, presumably <a href='#Moridin'>Moridin<\/a>, who helped him. During the fighting, their streams of balefire collided, causing Rand&apos;s head to spin and both of them to lose coherency for a while. Ever since that time, Rand has had trouble seizing <i>saidin<\/i>; it is not known if this is because of Moridin&apos;s presumed use of the True Power, or something else. During his fight with Semirhage, Rand had his hand burned away by her weave of Fire; Moridin has since been seen favoring his left hand, as if Rand&apos;s injury is somehow affecting him. Since the hand cannot be repaired, Rand has moved on without it&#x2014;others have compared it to the reaction one might have after losing a glove. Rand has steeled himself to do what he must, without emotional influence, without distraction from feelings. Rand&apos;s prophecies fulfilled grow: he has already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn <i>Callandor<\/i>, and began conquering &#x201C;under the forgotten symbol,&#x201D; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. He is working on having the &#x201C;spotless tower&#x201D; (i.e., the White Tower) break and bend knee to him (the Tower has broken, and several Aes Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him). He recently used the Choedan Kal, the two great <i>sa&apos;angreal<\/i> created during the War of the Shadow, to cleanse the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One<\/a>&apos;s taint from <i>saidin<\/i>. He has created schools of sorts, more research universities, where some of the best inventors of the day have congregated near Cairhien, Caemlyn, and Tear to develop new technology. Rand has also created the Asha&apos;man, men who came for his &#x201C;amnesty&#x201D; for male channelers. With <i>saidin<\/i> cleansed, the Asha&apos;man are now safe from the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One<\/a>&apos;s taint. The Asha&apos;man themselves are not free from the Dark One&apos;s <em>influence<\/em>, however; there are many Darkfriends among the Asha&apos;man, including <a href='#Taim'>Mazrim Taim<\/a>, the leader of the Black Tower. The Asha&apos;man under Taim have turned on Rand, trying to kill him and worse, though Rand does not at this point know that they were acting with Taim&apos;s knowledge. Rand is under <i>considerable<\/i> stress at the moment&#x2014;he has made it a point to make himself harder, believing that emotionlessness is the key to surviving to do what he must do. Rand is the salvation of the entire world, and as the prophecy states, he <em>will<\/em> save the world&#x2014;and Break it again.",

After being raised to the shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a>, and eventually came to lead the Blues&apos; network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being raised to the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat<\/a>. She was only thirty years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest Amyrlin to that point. She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations. Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all. When her twenty-year connection to the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a> was discovered, she and her <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles<\/a>, <a href='#Leane'>Leane Sharif<\/a>, were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida a&apos;Roihan<\/a>. Siuan hoped to regain some of her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from Elaida&#x2014;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to match, and she knows much that she thought would be of use. In one of her viewings, <a href='#Min'>Min<\/a> saw that Siuan would have to remain close to <a href='#Bryne'>Gareth Bryne<\/a>&#x2014;if she did not, both of them would die. Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the rebel army.

The fact that she is Aes Sedai, not to mention one who was stilled and Healed again, makes other sisters tend to be oblivious to this fact. She was pushed very hard by Elaida as a novice.

Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there. The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be &#x201C;of all Ajahs and none&#x201C;&#x2014;all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory). The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions. No Amyrlin had been raised from the Red Ajah since Bonwhin Meraighdin, who was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in <a href='#Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing<\/a>&apos;s day, except for <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida do Avriny a&apos;Roihan<\/a>, the current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah&#x2014;four of the last the last five Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah. These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one&apos;s Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles<\/a>, who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The Amyrlin Seat was held by <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a>. Her successor was the leader of the coup, <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida do Avriny a&apos;Roihan<\/a>, raised from the Red Ajah. Siuan&apos;s deposition divided the Tower, and the faction opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of choosing sides on the fateful day Siuan was deposed: <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere<\/a>, who was outside the Tower and not even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time Egwene was Raised. Other sisters outside the Tower have, in many cases, yet to reveal their loyalties to either Egwene or Elaida.",

His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great Blight. Lan, among the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status. He was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its style).

As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan&apos;s emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. The two of them are now married. According to the terms of their vows as taken before the Sea Folk, one of them must obey in public while the other obeys in private; for obvious reasons, Nynaeve is the one who commands in public.

Upon learning of where Lan was, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder for Nynaeve. He traveled with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai she accompanies until he started to feel longing for his homeland. Nynaeve understood that he needed to finish his fight in the Blight, but she vowed to increase his chance of survival by dropping him off at World&apos;s End in Saldaea and alerting every surviving Malkieri she could find that Lan was marching for Tarwin&apos;s Gap. According to the Wise Ones, <i>Aan&apos;allein<\/i> (as the Aiel call him) will die the day he learns that Nynaeve is dead.

                "info": "Young woman from Emond&apos;s Field, now an Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah. She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest such ever chosen in Emond&apos;s Field. She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine<\/a> and <a href='#Lan'>Lan<\/a>. While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine&apos;s Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her as well as a few young women still being trained. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice, despite not being able to even <em>sense<\/em> the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin<\/a> on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a> was. After she returned to the Tower, <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a> sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien<\/a> and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an <i>a&apos;dam<\/i> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod<\/i>. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href='#Rand'>Rand<\/a> and <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin<\/a> while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve then kept Moghedien under control with a modified <i>a&apos;dam<\/i> in Salidar until <a href='#Halima'>Halima<\/a> helped her escape. Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, and has already managed to Heal gentling. Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan&apos;s bond had been passed to <a href='#Myrelle'>Myrelle<\/a> at the moment of Moiraine&apos;s death. She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan&apos;s bond to pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together. She now wears the <i>ki&apos;sain<\/i>, an ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives, consisting of a dot on the forehead between the eyes&#x2014;Lan did not tell her of this tradition, but when she found out she immediately took it up. It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one second when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod<\/i>. Because she was the only person Rand felt he could trust to link with him and the Choedan Kal, he asked Nynaeve to assist him when he cleansed <i>saidin<\/i>. She now carries the <i>ter&apos;angreal<\/i> she found in Ebou Dar nearly all the time, making her collection of jewelry rival that of <a href='#Cadsuane'>Cadsuane<\/a>. She is even rumored to leave much of this jewelry on even when sleeping.",
