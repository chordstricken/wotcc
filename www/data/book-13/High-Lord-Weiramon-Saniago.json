He also controlled part of the massive\n      army Rand sent against Illian.  His sign is a silver Crescent-and-stars.\n      Rand kept him close to ensure he committed as few blunders as possible;\n      he can blunder with the worst of them.  He is only brave because he is\n      too stupid to be afraid.  He arranges his hair as if to emphasize just\n      how much he is balding.  He has an oiled, pointed beard.  He is tall.\n  "}]}
