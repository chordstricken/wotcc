The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen the Amyrlin is said to be &#x201C;of all Ajahs and none&#x201D;&#x2014;all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in principle).

Aviendha is one of the three women in <a href='#Min'>Min<\/a>&apos;s viewing of Rand&#x2014;she also saw that she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings in Rhuidean. She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became unavailable and she tried bathing as &#x201C;wetlanders&#x201D; did; Rand came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she panicked. She created a Traveling gateway to Seanchan (she does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible, into the middle of winter. When Rand rescued her, she decided she could not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the night in each other&apos;s arms before coming back. Aviendha says a similar incident will not occur, and punishes any Maiden who makes a crack about it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of the world on another continent is a different subject entirely). She felt <i>toh<\/i> toward <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne<\/a> for violating her trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once again.

She has recently been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way. She has, however, mastered the art of unraveling weaves&#x2014;a feat which was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken.

From this, and from <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve<\/a>&apos;s and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne<\/a>&apos;s information about the possibility of learning to channel (not just having it inborn), Egeanin reasoned that all <i>sul&apos;dam<\/i>, including Bethamin, could channel if they were taught&#x2014;which went against everything she had been taught her entire life. Bethamin is now forbidden from controlling <i>damane<\/i>, both as protection for her&#x2014;if anyone besides <a href='#Suroth'>Suroth<\/a> knew that the <i>a&apos;dam<\/i> would control her, they would probably make her wear it all the time&#x2014;and as protection for the Seanchan way of life, which would likely collapse if it was learned that <i>sul&apos;dam<\/i> could channel just as well as <i>damane<\/i>. Bethamin grew up in the Seanchan village of Abunai, on the Sea of L&#x2019;Heye. It was never cold there, and she has never been able to adapt to the cold weather she experiences now.",

The attempt to free the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow&apos;s side), during which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.

These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world.

                "info": "Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat<\/a> in Tar Valon. She was born the youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy. As a result of a Foretelling she had concerning the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon Gaidon, she served as advisor to <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase<\/a> of Andor for her entire reign, and led the coup that deposed <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a> and placed her on the Amyrlin Seat in Siuan&apos;s place. She distrusts anyone not of her Ajah (as most Reds do), and doesn&apos;t believe she will ever trust any member of the Blue Ajah again, even in the slightest. Her Keeper of the Chronicles is <a href='#Alviarin'>Alviarin Freidhen<\/a> of the White Ajah&#x2014;she was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of Siuan. If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <i>she<\/i> would have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan. She sometimes has the Foretelling, but not all that often or that strongly. One of her Foretellings was that the Royal Family of Andor would play a crucial role in the Last Battle&#x2014;this Foretelling occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne. Another was to predict that <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a> would shake the world on its very foundations&#x2014;she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time. Her most recent Foretelling was that &#x201C;the White Tower would be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever. <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a> will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds.&#x201D; The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly accurate. However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida&apos;s Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain. It may have meant Morgase, <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn<\/a>, Galad, and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne<\/a> (they have all had a large role to play in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old Royal Family, that of Tigraine, <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail<\/a>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well. After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a>. Her most recent Foretelling will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be; she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her. Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan, <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine<\/a>, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne<\/a>, <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve<\/a>, and a few others could match her strength. Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last Battle, and tried to capture Rand al&apos;Thor in an effort to gain similar control. The only sisters that support her are those that are actually Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually did shatter). Elaida is currently building a palace for herself atop the Warders&apos; old practice yard. The building will be about as tall as the White Tower.",

He confronted <a href='#Rand'>Rand<\/a> at the Eye of the World where he was severed from the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One<\/a>&apos;s bonds; he confronted him again at Falme where Rand put his sword through him and melted it, but not after Ishamael gave Rand a wound that he has not been able to recover from yet; and he confronted Rand in the Stone of Tear after he took <i>Callandor<\/i>. Rand killed Ishamael after beating him sore by plunging <i>Callandor<\/i> into his heart. His body rotted quickly, but it was proof that Ba&apos;alzamon, which he called himself to the public, was a human being, and not the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One<\/a>. However, death is not always final with the Dark One; with the appearance of two other Foraken presumed dead, it is likely that Ishamael has been resurrected as well.",

On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protects him from women&apos;s channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat&apos;s <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i> qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games&#x2014;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively.

He was raised by Tam al&apos;Thor and his wife Kari (until her death around the time Rand was five) in Emond&apos;s Field. His real parents, however, were Janduin, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish Laman&apos;s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named Shaiel, who was actually Tigraine Mantear, the runaway Daughter-Heir of Andor. Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy; &#x201C;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.&#x201D; Rand has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael<\/a>. He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him as the <i><a href='#Caracarn'>Car&apos;a&apos;carn<\/a><\/i>, the Chief of Chiefs of the Aiel. He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also He Who Comes With the Dawn, the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and the <a href='#Coramoor'>Coramoor<\/a>, the one prophesied to bring the Sea Folk out of the Sea. He can channel strongly, more so than any person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul, <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon<\/a>, who was obviously of equal strength), and is also <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i>, the most strongly so since Lews Therin as well. Lews Therin&apos;s voice has somehow found a new place inside of Rand&apos;s head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of <i>saidin<\/i> from him. Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days (hours, even) of him named <a href='#Mat'>Matrim Cauthon<\/a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara<\/a>, who both grew up in Emond&apos;s Field as well. Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has): <a href='#Min'>Min Farshaw<\/a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne Trakand<\/a>, and <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha<\/a>. Rand has had success in fighting many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped. He killed Aginor at the Eye of the World after the Green Man killed Balthamel; he allowed <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine<\/a> to kill Be&apos;lal in the Stone of Tear, and killed <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael<\/a> in the Stone shortly afterward; in the wagons near the Spine of the World, <a href='#Lanfear'>Lanfear<\/a> confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine; he killed <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin<\/a> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod<\/i> when he came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn; and Asmodean, his teacher, was killed shortly after Rahvin met his fate. His prophecies fulfilled grow: he has already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn <i>Callandor<\/i>, and began conquering &#x201C;under the forgotten symbol,&#x201D; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. He is working on having the &#x201C;spotless tower&#x201D; (i.e., the White Tower) break and bend knee to him (the Tower has broken, and several Aes Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him). He has also been bonded by <a href='#Alanna'>Alanna Mosvani<\/a>, an Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah, against his will&#x2014;the first such bonding in hundreds of years. He plans to use the Choedan Kal, the two great <i>sa&apos;angreal<\/i> created during the War of the Shadow, to cleanse the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One<\/a>&apos;s taint from <i>saidin<\/i>. He plans to do it soon, to prevent further problems with his Asha&apos;man, men who came for his &#x201C;amnesty&#x201D; against male channelers, going mad. He is the salvation of the entire world, and as the prophecy states, he <i>will<\/i> save the world&#x2014;and Break it again.",

As a novice, she was good friends with <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine Damodred<\/a>, and was present at Gitara Moroso&apos;s Foretelling of the Rebirth of the <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon<\/a>. After being raised to the shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a>, and eventually came to lead the Blues&apos; network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being raised to the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat<\/a>. She was only thirty years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest Amyrlin to date. She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations. Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all. When her twenty-year connection to the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a> was discovered, she and her Keeper of the Chronicles, Leane Sharif, were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida a&apos;Roihan<\/a>.

He is quite tall, and does not get very emotional&#x2014;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that he has been building for years. His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great Blight. Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status. He was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its style). When Lan and Moiraine brought <a href='#Rand'>Rand<\/a>, <a href='#Mat'>Mat<\/a>, <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin<\/a>, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a>, and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve<\/a> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he was the last to notice it: affection for Nynaeve. As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan&apos;s emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. The two of them are now married. Upon Moiraine&apos;s death, Lan&apos;s bond was immediately transferred to <a href='#Myrelle'>Myrelle<\/a> until Nynaeve is ready to have his bond transferred to her. Myrelle tried to keep Lan&apos;s status secret, but she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan&apos;s favorite foods, coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in southern climates). Upon learning of where Lan was, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder for Nynaeve. He now travels with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai she leads. According to the Wise Ones, <i><a href='#Aan'>Aan&apos;allein<\/a><\/i> (as the Aiel call him) will die the day he learns that Nynaeve is dead. He is one of the best, if not <i>the<\/i> best, warriors in the World.",

                "info": "Young woman from Emond&apos;s Field, now an Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah. She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest such ever chosen in Emond&apos;s Field. She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine<\/a> and <a href='#Lan'>Lan<\/a>. While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine&apos;s Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her as well as a few young women still being trained. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice, despite not being able to even <i>sense<\/i> the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin<\/a> on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a> was. After she returned to the Tower, <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a> sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien<\/a> and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an <i>a&apos;dam<\/i> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod<\/i>. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href='#Rand'>Rand<\/a> and <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin<\/a> while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve then kept Moghedien under control with a modified <i>a&apos;dam<\/i> in Salidar. Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, and has already managed to Heal gentling. Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan&apos;s bond had been passed to <a href='#Myrelle'>Myrelle<\/a> the moment of Moiraine&apos;s death. She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan&apos;s bond to pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together. She now wears the <i>ki&apos;sain<\/i>, an ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives, consisting of a dot on the forehead between the eyes&#x2014;Lan did not tell her of this tradition, but when she found out she immediately took it up. It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one second when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in <i>tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod<\/i>.",
