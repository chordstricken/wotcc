Around this time, Mierin had a relationship with <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who headed the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful and influential man she had found.

On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protected him from women&apos;s channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat&apos;s <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i> qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games&#x2014;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively.

She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine<\/a> and <a href='#Lan'>Lan<\/a>. While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for al&apos;Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine&apos;s Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a Novice, despite not being able to even <i>sense<\/i> the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin<\/a> on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a> was. After she returned to the Tower, <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a> sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien<\/a> and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an <i>a&apos;dam<\/i> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod<\/i>. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href='#Rand'>Rand<\/a> and <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin<\/a> while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve now keeps Moghedien under control with a modified <i>a&apos;dam<\/i> in Salidar. Nynaeve wishes to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, from severing to the wound on Rand&apos;s side. Nynaeve felt bad when <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine<\/a> died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan&apos;s bond had been passed to another at the moment of her death, or who that person is.",

He was raised by <a href='#Tam'>Tam al&apos;Thor<\/a> and his wife <a href='#Kari'>Kari<\/a> (until her death around the time Rand was five) in Emond&apos;s Field. His real parents, however, were <a href='#Janduin'>Janduin<\/a>, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish <a href='#Laman'>Laman<\/a>&apos;s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named <a href='#Shaiel'>Shaiel<\/a>, who was actually <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine Mantear<\/a>, the runaway <a href='#DH'>Daughter-Heir of Andor<\/a>. Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy; &#x201C;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.&#x201D; Rand has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael<\/a>. He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he recieved in Rhuidean to designate him as the <a href='#Caracarn'>Car&apos;a&apos;carn<\/a>, the Chief of Chiefs of the Aiel. He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also <a href='#Dawn'>He Who Comes With the Dawn<\/a>, the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and the <a href='#Coramoor'>Coramoor<\/a>, the one prophesied to bring the Sea Folk out of the Sea. He can channel strongly, more so than any person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul, <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon<\/a>, who was obviously of equal strength), and is also <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i>, the most strongly so since Lews Therin as well.

He is working on having the &#x201C;spotless tower&#x201D; break and bend knee to him, as well.

This hole, called the Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime. The attempt to free the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow&apos;s side), during which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.

These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world. These seals were scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the World. In order of when they were found, they were placed: (1) At the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); (2) in the hands of Bayle Domon, later pilfered by High Lord Turak of the Seanchan (broke at the battle of Falme), (3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak&apos;s collection (broken at the battle at Falme); (4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of Tear (still intact); (5) In the Panarch&apos;s Palace in Tanchico (broke enroute to Salidar); (6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and (7) Found by <a href='#Taim'>Mazrim Taim<\/a> (still intact). Despite being made of <i>cuendillar<\/i>, the three that remain unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a fall from a table. The Dark One is also referred to by other Euphemisms, including Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Father of Lies, Grassburner, Leafblighter, Heartsbane, Soulsbane, Lord of the Twilight, Father of Storms, Shepherd of the Night, and (among Darkfriends) Great Lord of the Dark.",

Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status. He was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its style).

As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan&apos;s emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. He loves her very much, whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise, loves him in return. Upon Moiraine&apos;s death, Lan&apos;s bond was immediately transferred to another Aes Sedai, and he was last seen leaving the wagons near Cairhien to seek her out.",
