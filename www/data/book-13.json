When Rand rescued her, she decided she could not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the night in each other&apos;s arms before coming back. Aviendha says a similar incident will not occur, and punished any Maiden who made a crack about it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of the world on another continent is a different subject entirely). She felt <i>toh<\/i> toward <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne<\/a> for violating her trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once again. She is not certain what she thinks of a <i>second<\/i> sister-wife in Min, but she seems to accept the idea at least. She has been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way. She has, however, mastered the art of untying weaves&#x2014;a feat which was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken. She and Elayne have adopted each other as first-sisters. Aviendha has a special ability in making wards against eavesdropping; it is unlikely even the Forsaken could breach one of her wards, and certainly no one could do so without her knowing it immediately. Aviendha was staying with Elayne at the Royal Palace in Caemlyn, but she was summoned away by the Wise Ones to complete her training. While in the Palace, she discovered a new Talent: the ability to sense the function of a <i>ter&apos;angreal<\/i> simply by holding it in her hands. Aviendha was very frustrated by the Wise Ones&apos; treatment of her when she returned from her stay with Elayne; they seemed to be punishing her for no reason she could ascertain, and continually asked her opinion of matters as if to test her responses. It turned out that this was the last part of her training to become a Wise One: she must tell the Wise Ones she is one of them, or at least demand to be treated as an equal by them. They were pushing her harder and faster than they typically push apprentices because they had no time: she was needed at the Last Battle, and they had no time to wait for her to become ready on her own. She is currently at Rhuidean, going through the crystal columns that are the <i>ter&apos;angreal<\/i> of Aiel history. She expects she knows what she will find there, and is not looking forward to watching what she perceives to be the failure of her people. She is due to arrive at Rand&apos;s encampment with <a href='#Rhuarc'>Rhuarc<\/a> and much of the rest of her clan soon.",

The attempt to free the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow&apos;s side), during which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.

                "info": "Young woman from Emond&apos;s Field and daughter of the innkeeper there, now raised to the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat<\/a>. She has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years. She is also the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent. Before her time with the Wise Ones, she was sold by Liandrin to <a href='#Suroth'>Suroth<\/a> to be made <i>damane<\/i>. She was held captive under the name Tuli under care of the <i>sul&apos;dam<\/i> Renna Emain. When Egwene escaped, she left Renna with her <i>a&apos;dam<\/i> around Renna&apos;s neck; the fact that Renna and another <i>sul&apos;dam<\/i>, <a href='#Seta'>Seta<\/a>, who was similarly captured when Egwene escaped, were bound by the <i>a&apos;dam<\/i> threatens to destroy the foundation of Seanchan society, especially their enslavement of women who can channel. Egwene is good friends with <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne Trakand<\/a>, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend of <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a>, the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a>. In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get married, and do not want to. Egwene is the love object of both of Elayne&apos;s brothers, <a href='#Galad'>Galad<\/a> and <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn<\/a>&#x2014;she is flattered by Galad&apos;s attentions, but she does not return them. She does find Gawyn to her liking, and had a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur, though she and Gawyn have some things to work out between the two of them. Egwene was most likely chosen Amyrlin because she was in the Aiel Waste when the rebellion occurred, and because the Aes Sedai thought she could be manipulated by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent, they made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the strongest Amyrlins in history. Egwene enlisted Gareth Bryne as the commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida<\/a> from power. The invasion turned out to be unnecessary&#x2014;Elaida was captured, and the Hall chose her to replace her before the invasion began. Egwene has opened the novice books to all interested women for the first time in history&#x2014;in the past, they were only open to girls of a certain age, for fear that older women would not be able to handle the discipline. This policy has increased the Tower&apos;s population to levels unseen since <a href='#Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing<\/a>&apos;s time. Egwene has also discovered many lost Talents of the Age of Legends, such as Dreaming, Traveling, and the making of <i>cuendillar<\/i>. She was guided to Dreaming by the Wise Ones, with whom she studied in the Aiel Waste, and was guided to the making of <i>cuendillar<\/i> by <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien<\/a> while she was captured, but Traveling was her discovery alone&#x2014;she worked it out herself based on her familiarity with Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod. She has recovered some other abilities through Moghedien as well. Prior to the reunification of the Tower, Egwene was captured by sisters loyal to Elaida after executing her plan to block the harbor by turning the harbor chain to <i>cuendillar<\/i>. She was held prisoner in the Tower, and re-enlisted as a Novice again. She accepted all punishments Elaida and others imposed upon her for insisting that she was still the Amyrlin Seat and still Aes Sedai. Her strong will and persistence earned her the respect of nearly all the novices, several of the Accepted, and more than a few Aes Sedai as well. Egwene&apos;s plans to subvert Elaida from the inside by making suggestions and hinting that various things Elaida has done are indefinsible helped convince even more sisters, including <a href='#Silviana'>Silviana<\/a>, to support her. Egwene tried very hard to convince the Hall&#x2014;both the Hall in Tar Valon and the Hall in Exile&#x2014;that they must be prepared for the Seanchan attack she knew was imminent. When it came anyway, she fought harder than perhaps anyone believed possible, doing almost as much damage to the Seanchan as they did to the Tower&apos;s inhabitants. Egwene was rescued from the Tower shortly after the raid by Gawyn, Bryne, and <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan<\/a>&#x2014;she was quite angry at Siuan and Gawyn for disobeying her orders to leave her be. Gawyn is still trying to crawl back into her good graces. She would probably refuse to acknowledge it, but she is almost as stubborn as <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve<\/a>.",

                "title": "Chapter 3: The Amyrlin's Anger",
                "info": "Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat<\/a> in Tar Valon. She was born the youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy. She occasionally has the Foretelling, and as a result of a Foretelling she had concerning the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon Gaidon, she served as advisor to <a href='#Morgase'>Queen Morgase<\/a> of Andor for her entire reign. She later led the coup that deposed <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a> and placed herself on the Amyrlin Seat in Siuan&apos;s place. She distrusts anyone not of the Red Ajah (as most Reds do), and does not think she will ever be able to trust any member of the Blue Ajah again. Her <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles<\/a> was <a href='#Alviarin'>Alviarin Freidhen<\/a> of the White Ajah&#x2014;she was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of Siuan. If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <i>she<\/i> would have been stilled and exiled from the Tower instead of Siuan. She eventually removed Alviarin and raised <a href='#Tarna'>Tarna Feir<\/a> in her place after Alviarin vanished for some months. Her Foretelling about the importance of Andor&apos;s royal family during the Last Battle occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne. Another of her Foretellings was to predict that <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a> would shake the world on its very foundations&#x2014;she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about him when he was right in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time. Her most recent Foretelling was that &#x201C;the White Tower would be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever. <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a> will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds.&#x201D; The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly accurate. However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida&apos;s Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain. It may have meant Morgase, <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn<\/a>, <a href='#Galad'>Galad<\/a>, and <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne<\/a> (they have all had a large role to play in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old Royal Family, that of <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine<\/a>, <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail<\/a>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well. After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a>. Her most recent Foretelling will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be; she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her. Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan (before she was stilled and Healed), <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine<\/a>, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne<\/a>, <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve<\/a>, and a few others could match her strength. Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last Battle, and tried to capture Rand al&apos;Thor in an effort to gain similar control. The only sisters that support her are those that are actually Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually <i>did<\/i> shatter). Elaida started to build a palace for herself atop the Warders&apos; old practice yard. The building was to be about as tall as the White Tower. She had no plans to be merciful to those who rebelled against her when she deposed Siuan&#x2014;her terms were that the Blue Ajah no longer existed, and that any sister who followed Egwene must serve penance under her personal guidance before being readmitted to the Tower. Elaida replaced Alviarin as Keeper with a sister of the Red Ajah, <a href='#Tarna'>Tarna Feir<\/a>, and she has suspicions that Alviarin was trying to commit treason against the Tower. She ordered <a href='#Seaine'>Seaine Herimon<\/a> to &#x201C;follow the trail of treason&#x201D; as far as it went, even to the Keeper herself. Seaine interpreted this as a charge to capture members of the Black Ajah, leading to a grave situation for Seaine, as she now has several Black sisters that she has uncovered and no longer feels she can trust Elaida. Elaida continually ignored Egwene&apos;s warnings about a Seanchan attack; when the attack came, Elaida was woefully unprepared, and a significant fraction of the Tower was captured and made <i>damane<\/i>, including herself. She is currently held captive as a <i>damane<\/i> named <a href='#Suffa'>Suffa<\/a>. She knows the weave for Traveling, and it is very unlikely she will be able to hold back that knowledge from the Seanchan.",

When she became a Hunter, she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering adopting the name &#x201C;Mandarb&#x201D;&#x2014;she chose Faile when she found that <a href='#Mandarb'>Mandarb<\/a> was the name of <a href='#Lan'>Lan<\/a>&apos;s horse.

During the chaos that erupted after <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a>&apos;s deposition, Gawyn formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders except Galad, who are called the Younglings. The Younglings fought back against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and <a href='#Leane'>Leane<\/a> from their imprisonment. Gawyn himself killed <a href='#Hammar'>Hammar<\/a> and Coulin, the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training, respectively, both of which were Blademasters&#x2014;few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them. When he learned more of what actually happened, Gawyn did not know which party to support&#x2014;he believed that anyone who opposed Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was wrong, but at the same time he realized he did not know all the facts surrounding the change in leadership. In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve al&apos;Meara<\/a> and <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere<\/a> side with those who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is their new leader. He believes the rumor that <a href='#Rand'>Rand<\/a> killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene made him promise not to. Gawyn has made many enemies inside and outside the Tower, just by leading the Younglings. He detests Rand because he thinks Rand killed his mother, and there is no telling how he will react when he finds out that Elayne actually does love Rand. Gawyn led the Younglings on harrying parties against the army besieging Tar Valon; Lord Bryne was quite upset to find out that it was someone who had inside information about his tactics that was harrying him so successfully. At one time, Gawyn had no problem with the fact that he had killed his former teachers&#x2014;they were rebelling against a lawfully raised Amyrlin&#x2014;but he has since begun to feel guilty, wondering if he had truly chosen the just side. He has stated that he did not like Elaida&#x2014;she had always been cold to him as his mother&apos;s advisor&#x2014;but he supported her because he disliked what Siuan had done, involving Egwene and Elayne in her plotting. Eventually, he learned that Egwene herself lead the rebels, and that she had been captured. He stubbornly refused to believe she could <i>possibly<\/i> be safe as a prisoner, and vowed to do anything to rescue her. He eventually jumped at the chance to help Siuan mount a rescue; Egwene is quite angry at him (and at Siuan) for disobeying her direct orders. Gawyn is trying to discover what his relationship to Egwene needs to be as her Warder, which of course he must do before she bonds him. He is finding that situation very trying&#x2014;he is used to being his own person. His sign is a white boar.",

Mierin never let go of him, and when he later met and married Ilyena Moerelle, she tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by any means. Eventually, she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to the Shadow, most likely to finally get back at Lews Therin for leaving her.

Instead of petitioning to re-enter the Blue Ajah, she asked the Green Ajah if it would accept her; it did, and she became the first sister to ever switch Ajahs. Her eyes-and-ears as Keeper are retained by her; she was the only Aes Sedai to plant spies in the city itself.

Along with his good friends, <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara<\/a>, he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after Winternight. On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protects him from women&apos;s channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat&apos;s <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i> qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games&#x2014;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories, he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including Eldrin and Bodewhin, who were 16 and 17, respectively, when Mat left Emond&apos;s Field. His father Abell is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers, probably in the World. Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&#x2014;his collection would surprise anyone. In the Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan. However, she was not the <a href='#9Moons'>Daughter of the Nine Moons<\/a>, who Mat was destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends. Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regretted it deeply. He also has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to hang him&#x2014;which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &#x201C;to die and live again.&#x201D; He created an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old Manetheren, and served in a way as Rand&apos;s personal general&#x2014;this worked well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even <a href='#Bashere'>Davram Bashere<\/a>, who has earned his reputation as one of the best commanders alive. Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a bath. Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne<\/a> and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve<\/a> and prevent them from getting themselves killed. While there, he was cornered by <a href='#Tylin'>Queen Tylin<\/a>, who gave him little choice but to become her lover. When the Sea Folk and the Seanchan did battle in the city, he made his escape, leaving Tylin tied up under the bed so it looked &#x201C;official&#x201D;&#x2014;Tylin was found torn limb from limb, obviously by the <i>gholam<\/i>, which was no doubt sent to kill Mat. In the process of leaving, Mat also took several <i>sul&apos;dam<\/i> and <i>damane<\/i> (who were subsequently freed from their collars), and even kidnapped <a href='#Tuon'>Tuon<\/a>, the <a href='#9Moons'>Daughter of the Nine Moons<\/a> herself. Mat traveled with <a href='#Luca'>Valan Luca<\/a>&apos;s show to keep out of Seanchan sight for quite some time. Tuon has now completed Mat&apos;s unwitting marriage ceremony; he is now among the highest of the Seanchan ruling class, the <a href='#Ravens'>First Prince of the Ravens<\/a>, despite his insistence that he will fight the Seanchan during any battle if such battle is necessary. Mat is as yet unaware that Tuon is (metaphorically) dead, and that his wife is now the <a href='#Empress'>Empress<\/a> of Seanchan, <a href='#Fortuona'>Fortuona<\/a>. Mat still has one major task ahead of him: answering <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine<\/a>&apos;s letter to <a href='#Thom'>Thom<\/a>, which asks him to help rescue her from the Eelfinn. Mat is currently in Caemlyn, asking <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne<\/a> for help producing <a href='#Aludra'>Aludra<\/a>&apos;s dragons, what most of us would call cannons.",

Born of a noble House in Cairhien, she is <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail Damodred<\/a>&apos;s youngest half-sister, and <a href='#Laman'>King Laman<\/a>&apos;s niece. She is considered short among her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people. When it was discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai. Just before being raised to the shawl, she and her friend <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a> witnessed Gitara Moroso&apos;s Foretelling of the Rebirth of the <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon<\/a>. Moiraine and Siuan walked away from each other and did not speak to each other again (at least in public), but both held secret communication with each other and dedicated their lives to finding and guiding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a>. Moiraine found the young man she sought on Winternight in Emond&apos;s Field, a young man named <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a>, along with two more <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i>, <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon<\/a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara<\/a>, and two women with the spark of the Power inborn, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere<\/a> and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve al&apos;Meara<\/a>. When Moiraine was shortly raised to the shawl, she met <a href='#Lan'>al&apos;Lan Mandragoran<\/a>, the uncrowned King of Malkier, who was fighting alone against the Shadow in the Borderlands; she eventually asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted. She was very strong in the Power, stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai before Egwene and Nynaeve came to the Tower. In the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken Be&apos;lal with balefire, just before he would have killed Rand. Later, after having an inkling of the future events from the testing <i>ter&apos;angreal<\/i> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to push the Forsaken <a href='#Lanfear'>Lanfear<\/a> through the twisted doorway <i>ter&apos;angreal<\/i> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both her and Lanfear there.

The same letter convinced <a href='#Mat'>Mat<\/a> to help Thom rescue her, though her vision in the <i>ter&apos;angreal<\/i> apparently indicated disaster would result unless Mat <i>asked<\/i> to see the letter before Thom showed it to him.

She married <a href='#Taringail'>Taringail Damodred<\/a>, a prince of Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the Throne of Andor and keep peace between the two nations; when <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine<\/a> disappeared, Morgase made the best claim to succeed her, and married her widower to gain the support that would be gained by such action. Taringail was Elayne&apos;s and Gawyn&apos;s father; he died when they were young. Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including <a href='#Thom'>Thomdril Merrilin<\/a>, a former court-bard; Gareth Bryne, her First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Guards; and most recently <a href='#Gaebril'>Lord Gaebril<\/a>, a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase&apos;s trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne&apos;s whereabouts. Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power. The Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive. She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand. She was previously advised by <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida do Avriny a&apos;Roihan<\/a> of the Red Ajah, who is now the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat<\/a> in Tar Valon. When Morgase discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was actually <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin<\/a>) meant to usurp her throne, she left, and when she learned that the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a> had taken over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could: <a href='#Niall'>Pedron Niall<\/a> and the Children of the Light. She was not aware that <a href='#Rand'>Rand<\/a> only wanted to give her country back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead. If she had made her presence known, she would no doubt have had her country back in one piece, but as royalty she believed she must work on her own and trust no one. She went into hiding after the Seanchan attack (<a href='#Valda'>Eamon Valda<\/a> believes her to be dead) under her mother&apos;s first name, Maighdin to avoid instant recognition, and later became a maidservant to <a href='#Faile'>Faile<\/a>; she told Faile that she was a lady&apos;s handmaid before coming into her service. When Faile&apos;s group was captured, she became a prisoner of the Shaido, and is now detained in their encampment. Her sign is three golden keys. Morgase has come to many realizations about her life, and about her choice in men: Taringail saw her as a pawn, Thom as a beauty to be hunted and romanced, Gareth Bryne as a queen to be served. None had made her his entire life. However, a former member of the Queen&apos;s Guard, <a href='#Tallanvor'>Martyn Tallanvor<\/a>, has taken a liking to his former queen, and she finds herself almost unconsciously returning his attentions. Her adopted son <a href='#Galad'>Galad<\/a> believes her dead at the hands of Eamon Valda, and plans revenge on him.

Her daughter Elayne believes her dead as well (though she as yet has no plans for vengeance), and her new mistress Faile has no idea of her true identity. Since we know from Rand&apos;s visions of <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin<\/a> that Galad and Perrin eventually cross paths, it appears that a family reunion is in the works.",

Moridin helped Rand, in a way, during his fight with Sammael in Shadar Logoth.

Its influence is clear, however&#x2014;now that Rand&apos;s hand is missing, Moridin&apos;s left hand does not work as well as it should. Moridin has recently granted <a href='#Graendal'>Graendal<\/a> some limited access to the True Power, though he has her on a short leash. He is a grand master at the game of Sha&apos;rah, a chess-like game from the Age of Legends; Moridin believes the game to be a distant memory of the battle with the Dark One during this Age in the previous turnings of the Wheel. His connection with Rand recently allowed Rand to enter his dreams; the same connection seems to have given Rand access to the True Power. He turned to the Shadow for reasons of logic: following the Light meant the struggle continued forever, with no path to victory. Following the Shadow meant ruling for a short time before everything was destroyed.",

When he and <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a> got separated from the rest of the group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named <a href='#Elyas'>Elyas Machera<\/a>. Elyas, a former Warder who found he could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in himself. Perrin&apos;s eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves&apos; eyes, and he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod<\/i>, the World of Dreams) with them. Perrin is a childhood friend of fellow <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i> <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a> and <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon<\/a>. On the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of <a href='#Zarine'>Zarine Bashere<\/a>, a Hunter for the Horn who took the name of <a href='#Faile'>Faile<\/a> (which means &#x201C;Falcon&#x201D; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a Hunter for the Horn. The two are now married. Perrin is a very large man&#x2014;he was always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got out of hand. His size helped considerably when helping <a href='#Luhhan'>Master Luhhan<\/a> on his forge, but that combined with his careful nature sometimes gave others the impression that he is slow and stupid. He returned to the Two Rivers for a time to repel the series of Trolloc attacks; he and his wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the first noblility of the Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars. When he returned, he began to draw the eye of <a href='#Berelain'>Berelain sur Paendrag Paeron<\/a>, the First of Mayene&#x2014;Perrin wants nothing more than to be as far from her as possible, but Berelain will not take no for an answer, much to Faile&apos;s dismay and intense jealousy. Perrin was instrumental in freeing Rand from his entrapment at Dumai&apos;s Wells; the two had a fight afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to leave, although they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as it was), and Perrin went to Ghealdan to see if he could tame <a href='#Masema'>Masema<\/a>. On the way, his wife was captured by Shaido, and he spent weeks single-mindedly trying to track her down. He eventually formed an alliance with Tylee Khirgan, a Seanchan Banner-General, to help him defeat the Shaido and free his wife. Despite his strong desires to avoid both combat and lordship, Perrin has become a very good general and leader. He is currently mired in Ghealdan, and is having some issues keeping the man in him separate from the wolf.",

She is also half-sister to <a href='#Galad'>Galad<\/a>, although she would rather not be reminded of this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not really like him. She has considerable potential in the One Power, and is one of the strongest female channelers in a thousand years or more, possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exceptions of <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a>, <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve<\/a>, Sharina, <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha<\/a>, and some trainees. She has red-gold curly hair. During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne realized she loved <a href='#Rand'>Rand al&apos;Thor<\/a>, and told him how she felt; he felt similarly. She had no idea at the time what <a href='#Min'>Min<\/a> meant about &#x201C;having to share him,&#x201D; but now knows about Min&apos;s viewing of Rand with the three women&apos;s heads, indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and Aviendha, and they with him. Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien<\/a>, Elayne ended up bonding <a href='#Birgitte'>Birgitte<\/a> as her Warder (despite being only Accepted at the time) in order to save Birgitte&apos;s life. Elayne later went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a <i>ter&apos;angreal<\/i> that they used to fix the weather. She then returned to Andor upon hearing news of her mother&apos;s disappearance; she has since taken the Lion Throne, fighting the Black Ajah, Darkfriends, and other Andoran nobles. She recently ended <a href='#Arymilla'>Arymilla<\/a>&apos;s campaign for the Throne, which convinced all but one of the necessary nobles to support her for the Lion Throne. During that campaign, Elayne was captured by the Black Ajah, though Birgitte convinced the Windfinders to help rescue her. She then convinced several other houses to support her&#x2014;evidently their main concern was that she would be a puppet of Rand al&apos;Thor. In the mean time, Elayne has managed to reproduce several <i>ter&apos;angreal<\/i>, something which no one else has been able to do since the Breaking of the World, as well as discover a way to share a Warder bond between three women; she bonded Rand along with Aviendha, her new sister by Aiel tradition, and Min. Shortly after bonding Rand, she became pregnant with Rand&apos;s twins. To protect the children, she is not revealing the father of the twins, and has allowed the rumor that <a href='#Mellar'>Doilin Mellar<\/a> is their father to persist as an added means of protection. She is the first ruler of Andor to <i>ever<\/i> cede land to anyone: she agreed with the Sea Folk to cede a few square miles of Andor to them in exchange for their help feeding the city during the siege. She also sends Andoran troops to the Black Tower (which is on Andoran soil) periodically to remind its inhabitants that they are still within Andor and subject to its laws. She is proving to be a capable leader, one her people may eventually be quite proud of, though for now times in Andor are hard enough that most do not appreciate her yet.",

He is very tall, with curly red-blond hair and bright blue-gray eyes that shine like gemstones. He was raised by <a href='#Tam'>Tam al&apos;Thor<\/a> and his wife Kari (until her death around the time Rand was five) in Emond&apos;s Field. His real parents, however, were Janduin, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish <a href='#Laman'>Laman<\/a>&apos;s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named Shaiel, who was actually <a href='#Tigraine'>Tigraine Mantear<\/a>, the runaway Daughter-Heir of Andor. Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy: &#x201C;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.&#x201D; Rand has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael<\/a>. He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him as the <i><a href='#Caracarn'>Car&apos;a&apos;carn<\/a><\/i>, the Chief of Chiefs of the Aiel. He has recently taken to wearing a new sword: curved, with a black scabbard, painted with two twisting dragons much like those on his forearms. It was found under a submerged statue. He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also He Who Comes With the Dawn, the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and the <a href='#Coramoor'>Coramoor<\/a>, the one prophesied to bring the Sea Folk out of the Sea. He can channel strongly, more so than any person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul, <a href='#Lews'>Lews Therin Telamon<\/a>, who was obviously of equal strength), and is also <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i>, the most strongly so since Lews Therin as well. Lews Therin&apos;s voice seemed to have found a new place inside of Rand&apos;s head for some time; he talked to him in a mad voice when Rand least expected it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of <i>saidin<\/i> from him. <a href='#Semirhage'>Semirhage<\/a> revealed that hearing this voice was a symptom of the madness associated with touching tainted <i>saidin<\/i> for as long as Rand did. Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days (hours, even) of him named <a href='#Mat'>Matrim Cauthon<\/a> and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin Aybara<\/a>, who both grew up in Emond&apos;s Field as well. Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has): <a href='#Min'>Min Farshaw<\/a>, <a href='#Elayne'>Elayne Trakand<\/a>, and <a href='#Aviendha'>Aviendha<\/a>. Rand has had success in fighting many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped. He killed <a href='#Aginor'>Aginor<\/a> at the Eye of the World after the Green Man killed Balthamel; he allowed <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine<\/a> to kill Be&apos;lal in the Stone of Tear, and killed <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael<\/a> in the Stone shortly afterward; in the wagons near the Spine of the World, <a href='#Lanfear'>Lanfear<\/a> confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine; he killed <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin<\/a> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod<\/i> when he came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn; <a href='#Asmodean'>Asmodean<\/a>, his teacher, was killed shortly after Rahvin met his fate; Sammael met his fate while fighting Rand in Shadar Logoth at the hands of Mashadar; Osan&apos;gar, the reincarnation of <a href='#Aginor'>Aginor<\/a>, died at Shador Logoth when Rand was cleansing <i>saidin<\/i>; <a href='#Semirhage'>Semirhage<\/a> was captured during her attempt to capture Rand and bind him with a male <i>a&apos;dam<\/i>; and <a href='#Arangar'>Aran&apos;gar<\/a> died when he attacked <a href='#Graendal'>Graendal<\/a>&apos;s hold at <a href='#Natrin'>Natrin<\/a>&apos;s Barrow. During his duel with Sammael, Rand encountered a mysterious wanderer, who turned out to be <a href='#Moridin'>Moridin<\/a>, who helped him. During the fighting, their streams of balefire collided, causing Rand&apos;s head to spin and both of them to lose coherency for a while. Ever since that time, Rand has had trouble seizing <i>saidin<\/i>; it is not known if this is because of Moridin&apos;s use of the True Power or something else. During his fight with Semirhage, Rand had his hand burned away by her weave of Fire; Moridin has since been seen favoring his left hand, as if Rand&apos;s injury is somehow affecting him. Since the hand cannot be repaired, Rand has moved on without it&#x2014;others have compared it to the reaction one might have after losing a glove. Rand was captured for a brief period by <a href='#Semirhage'>Semirhage<\/a>, after <a href='#Shaidar'>Shaidar Haran<\/a> freed her from her captivity at Aes Sedai hands. She attempted to force him to choke Min to death, but Rand&apos;s connection to Moridin evidently allowed him to access the True Power, and he used that connection to weave balefire and destroy Semirhage. Thereafter, Rand steeled himself to do what he must, without emotional influence, without distraction from feelings, until finally the emotions grew too much to handle&#x2014;he finally Traveled to Dragonmount, standing upon his own grave in fulfillment of Prophecy, and contemplated his life, and all of his past lives, finally determining that life and creation were not worth it unless you could laugh and cry. He destroyed the male Choedan Kal, and seems to have cured his madness (or at least blocked it somehow) in the process. Rand&apos;s prophecies fulfilled grow: he has already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn <i>Callandor<\/i>, and began conquering &#x201C;under the forgotten symbol,&#x201D; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. He is working on having the &#x201C;spotless tower&#x201D; (i.e., the White Tower) break and bend knee to him (the Tower has broken, and several Aes Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him). He slayed &#x201C;his people&#x201D; (the Aiel) with the &#x201C;sword of peace&#x201D; and destroyed them &#x201C;with the [Way of the] Leaf&#x201D; (referring to his dividing the Aiel with news that they used to be a peacful, non-violent people). He has &#x201C;wounds of madness&#x201D; from Fain&apos;s dagger (and from the taint), and has led the Aiel spears &#x201C;from the city, lost and forsaken&#x201D; (Rhuidean). And of course, he has stood &#x201C;on his own grave&#x201D; and wept, referring to his scene at Dragonmount where he went from being &#x201C;blind&#x201D; to the reasons for life to &#x201C;seeing&#x201D; the reasons of life again. Some time ago, he used the Choedan Kal, the two great <i>sa&apos;angreal<\/i> created during the War of the Shadow, to cleanse the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One<\/a>&apos;s taint from <i>saidin<\/i>. He has created schools of sorts, more research universities, where some of the best inventors of the day have congregated near Cairhien, Caemlyn, and Tear to develop new technology. Rand has also created the Asha&apos;man, men who came for his &#x201C;amnesty&#x201D; for male channelers. With <i>saidin<\/i> cleansed, the Asha&apos;man are now safe from the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One<\/a>&apos;s taint.

She was called to all corners of the world to Heal people that others thought beyond help. However, she was sadistic; she exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for her Healing services. Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of being either severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her &#x201C;pleasures.&#x201D; She chose instead to pledge for the <a href='#Dark'>Dark One<\/a>, and created one of the most oppressive and pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power. She became an expert at sadism and torture; she considers her greatest achievement to be a weave which removes the victim&apos;s blood and replaces it, instantaneously, with another liquid that causes every nerve in the body to fire with pain simultaneously&#x2014;the victims typically survived about an hour. After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai. She also sent the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that Sammael sent. She was as tall as most men, and wore black most of the time&#x2014;perhaps because <a href='#Lanfear'>Lanfear<\/a> always wore white. It is often joked (or used to be, when the Forsaken were still bound) that when it rained during the daylight that the Dark One was beating her.

                "info": "Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah with shoulder-length hair. Born in Tear to a fisherman, she was sent to the White Tower on the first boat to leave after she discovered she had the ability to channel inborn, according to Tairen law. As a novice, she was good friends with <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine Damodred<\/a>, and was present at Gitara Moroso&apos;s Foretelling of the Rebirth of the <a href='#Dragon'>Dragon<\/a>. After being raised to the shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a>, and eventually came to lead the Blues&apos; network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being raised to the <a href='#Amyrlin'>Amyrlin Seat<\/a>. She was only thirty years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest Amyrlin to that point. She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations. Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all. When her twenty-year connection to the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a> was discovered, she and her <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles<\/a>, <a href='#Leane'>Leane Sharif<\/a>, were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida a&apos;Roihan<\/a>. Siuan and Leane escaped with <a href='#Min'>Min<\/a>&apos;s help and found the rebel Aes Sedai in Salidar. Siuan hoped to regain some of her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from Elaida&#x2014;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to match, and she knows much that she thought would be of use. In one of her viewings, <a href='#Min'>Min<\/a> saw that Siuan would have to remain close to Gareth Bryne&#x2014;if she did not, both of them would die. Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the rebel army. She later realized that the viewing was related to the attack on the Tower by the Seanchan. Siuan had a Warder named Alric, but he was murdered by Elaida when Siuan was deposed. After coming to Salidar, <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve<\/a> discovered how to restore Siuan&apos;s ability to channel, at least partially. This resurrected a part of her bond with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding by the Oath Rod. She could lie as well as any child, at least until she re-swore the Three Oaths shortly before the Tower was reunited. She served as an advisor of sorts to the new Amyrlin in Salidar, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere<\/a>, but though she put on a fa&#xE7;ade of hating the work, she was actually one of Egwene&apos;s foremost agents. The fact that she was Aes Sedai, not to mention one who was stilled and Healed again, made other sisters tend to be oblivious to that fact. She was pushed very hard by Elaida as a novice. While Egwene was being held prisoner in the Tower, Siuan was charged with keeping the factions among the rebels&#x2014;headed by <a href='#Romanda'>Romanda Cassin<\/a> and <a href='#Lelaine'>Lelaine Akashi<\/a>, respectively&#x2014;from usurping the rebellion and placing <i>themselves<\/i> on the Amyrlin Seat. When the Seanchan attacked, Siuan decided she had had enough of Egwene&apos;s stubborn insistance not to rescue her. She easily convinced <a href='#Gawyn'>Gawyn<\/a> to come with her, and eventually convinced Gareth Bryne to come with as well, on two conditions: she bond Bryne as her Warder, which she did immediately, and that she marry him. The second condition has yet to be met. Bryne saved her life when a Seanchan assassin creeped up behind her while she was Healing Bryne&apos;s troops; he thrust his sword into the apparition&apos;s chest area, knowing that he would die if the blow did not land, and saved her life. She then saved <i>his<\/i> life by Healing him of the poison the assassin injected right before dying himself, thus satisfying Min&apos;s viewing. Siuan has an unusual Talent: she can see <i>ta&apos;veren<\/i>.",

His story could have been drawn from legends: he had lain wounded for hours before managing to pull himself into the saddle by the reins; the horse carried him, nearly unconscious, for hours before arriving at a village, where the villagers had been tempted to sell him to a group of bandits. The mayor&apos;s daughter argued for his life, convincing everyone that only Darkfriends would seek wounded Warders. The villagers hid him, and the girl nursed him to health. He was forced to leave in secret, as the girl had taken a liking to him, but in return he hunted down the bandits and killed them so they would never trouble the village again.

                "info": "The leader of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen. She in theory holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall of the Tower at its meetings. Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there. The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be &#x201C;of all Ajahs and none&#x201C;&#x2014;all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory). The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions. No Amyrlin had been raised from the Red Ajah since Bonwhin Meraighdin, who was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in <a href='#Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing<\/a>&apos;s day, except for <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida do Avriny a&apos;Roihan<\/a>, raised Amyrlin in Tar Valon after a coup deposed <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a>; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah&#x2014;four of the last the last five Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah. These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one&apos;s Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles<\/a>, who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The Amyrlin Seat was held by <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the <a href='#Reborn'>Dragon Reborn<\/a>. Her successor was the leader of the coup, <a href='#Elaida'>Elaida do Avriny a&apos;Roihan<\/a>, raised from the Red Ajah. Siuan&apos;s deposition divided the Tower, and the faction opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of choosing sides on the fateful day Siuan was deposed: <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene al&apos;Vere<\/a>, who was outside the Tower and not even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time Egwene was Raised. Other sisters outside the Tower, in many cases, did not reveal their loyalties to either Egwene or Elaida. Egwene was captured by forces loyal to Elaida during a partially successful attempt to turn the harbor chains to <i>cuendillar<\/i>; Elaida re-enlisted her as a Novice, and treated her as a disobedient, stubborn child. Egwene remained defiant to the very last, trying to garner support from within. Elaida stubbornly refused to acknowledge Egwene&apos;s warnings of a Seanchan attack; that very attack, when it occurred, claimed Elaida herself as a prisoner of the Seanchan. After two tense days, filled with revelations of the Black Ajah, the aftermath of the Seanchan attack, and a near-invasion by Egwene&apos;s army, the Hall Selected a new Amyrlin: Egwene al&apos;Vere, raised from the Accepted (no Ajah).",

Her Warder is named Tomas. She is more interested in current events than the average Brown; most of them could not care less what happened now, only what happened years ago. She gave Egwene the twisted stone ring <i>ter&apos;angreal<\/i> to assist her in Dreaming, and also once told <a href='#Morgase'>Morgase<\/a> that there was really no need to keep her in the Tower until she learned to control her ability when she was a novice, since she would never be able to do much with it anyway. When Verin went to the Two Rivers with <a href='#Alanna'>Alanna<\/a>, they helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including <a href='#Mat'>Mat<\/a>&apos;s sister Bode. When she and Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town. Verin is quite old&#x2014;her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai means she is quite old indeed. She communicated with <a href='#Cadsuane'>Cadsuane<\/a>&apos;s group of sisters in Tear, but has since departed their company. Verin always seems to follow her own agenda, though <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan<\/a> once said she had always trusted her, even though she knew she could trust no one. She and Thomas have been waiting for Mat for some time; she is the one who posted fliers of him and <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin<\/a> throughout the countryside, hoping to scare one of them up. Known to virtually no one until an hour before her death, Verin was a member of the Black Ajah. She was given the choice one day to take her oaths to serve the Dark One or be executed. She took the oaths to save her own skin; once inducted, she carefully but persistently studied the Black Ajah&#x2014;how it is organized, what its rules are, and, most importantly, who its members are. She found Tomas, who was a Darkfriend seeking a way out, and he agreed to become her Warder. She wrote down all of her notes, including a list of about 200 sisters she had discovered, in a dense tome that she gave to Egwene al&apos;Vere after drinking poison. The poison would kill her in one hour, which released her from her oath: &#x201C;I swear not to betray the <a href='#Dark'>Great Lord<\/a>, to keep my secrets until the hour of my death.&#x201D; Her bravery allowed Egwene to gut the Black Ajah among the rebels, starting with her <a href='#Keeper'>Keeper of the Chronicles<\/a>, <a href='#Sheriam'>Sheriam Bayanar<\/a>, and a Sitter for the Blue Ajah, Moria Karentanis. Verin also left a note with <a href='#Mat'>Mat Cauthon<\/a> just before going to the Tower to spill her secret to Egwene; she made him promise not to open it until several days had passed, but that if he opened it he had to do what it said.

He is quite tall, and does not get very emotional&#x2014;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that he has been building for years. His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great Blight. Lan, among the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status. He was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its style). When Lan and Moiraine brought <a href='#Rand'>Rand<\/a>, <a href='#Mat'>Mat<\/a>, <a href='#Perrin'>Perrin<\/a>, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a>, and <a href='#Nynaeve'>Nynaeve<\/a> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he was the last to notice it: affection for Nynaeve. As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan&apos;s emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. The two of them are now married. According to the terms of their vows as taken before the Sea Folk, one of them must obey in public while the other obeys in private; for obvious reasons, Nynaeve is the one who commands in public. Upon Moiraine&apos;s death, Lan&apos;s bond was immediately transferred to <a href='#Myrelle'>Myrelle<\/a> until Nynaeve is ready to have his bond transferred to her. Myrelle tried to keep Lan&apos;s status secret, but she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan&apos;s favorite foods, coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in southern climates). Upon learning of where Lan was, <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder for Nynaeve. He traveled with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai she accompanied until he started to feel longing for his homeland. Nynaeve understood that he needed to finish his fight in the Blight, but she vowed to increase his chance of survival by dropping him off at World&apos;s End in Saldaea and alerting every surviving Malkieri she could find that Lan was marching for Tarwin&apos;s Gap. According to the Wise Ones, <i><a href='#Aan'>Aan&apos;allein<\/a><\/i> (as the Aiel call him) will die the day he learns that Nynaeve is dead. He is one of the best, if not <i>the<\/i> best, warriors, swordsmen, and Warders in the world. Lan was determined to avoid all signs of civilization in the Borderlands, intending to ride to Tarwin&apos;s Gap himself. Nynaeve had other plans, however; she visited dozens of locations throughout the Borderlands and alerted any Malkieri she could find of Lan&apos;s mission. He still intends to turn as many of them away as he can, but he may have little choice in the matter.",

                "info": "Young woman from Emond&apos;s Field, now an Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah. She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest such ever chosen in Emond&apos;s Field. She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by <a href='#Moiraine'>Moiraine<\/a> and <a href='#Lan'>Lan<\/a>. While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine&apos;s Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her as well as a few young women still being trained. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice, despite not being able to even <em>sense<\/em> the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by Liandrin on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as <a href='#Egwene'>Egwene<\/a> was. After she returned to the Tower, <a href='#Siuan'>Siuan Sanche<\/a> sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien<\/a> and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an <i>a&apos;dam<\/i> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod<\/i>. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href='#Rand'>Rand<\/a> and <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin<\/a> while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve then kept Moghedien under control with a modified <i>a&apos;dam<\/i> in Salidar until Halima helped her escape. Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, and has already managed to Heal gentling. Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan&apos;s bond had been passed to <a href='#Myrelle'>Myrelle<\/a> at the moment of Moiraine&apos;s death. She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan&apos;s bond to pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together. She now wears the <i>ki&apos;sain<\/i>, an ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives, consisting of a dot on the forehead between the eyes&#x2014;Lan did not tell her of this tradition, but when she found out, she immediately took it up. It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one second when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod<\/i>. Because she was the only person Rand felt he could trust to link with him and the Choedan Kal, he asked Nynaeve to assist him when he cleansed <i>saidin<\/i>. She now carries the <i>ter&apos;angreal<\/i> she found in Ebou Dar nearly all the time, making her collection of jewelry rival that of <a href='#Cadsuane'>Cadsuane<\/a>. She is even rumored to leave much of this jewelry on even when sleeping. Nynaeve knew she could not prevent Lan from returning to the Blight to fight his one-man war, so she deposited him as far from Tarwin&apos;s Gap as possible while still remaining in the Borderlands, then alerted every surviving Malkieri she could find to Lan&apos;s mission.",
