Her real name is\n      <a href=\"#Zarine\">Zarine Bashere</a>;\n      she assumed the name Faile upon becoming a Hunter of the Horn.\n      She has long dark hair and dark eyes.  Zarine is the daughter of\n      <a href=\"#Bashere\">Davram Bashere</a>, the Marshal-General of Saldaea\n      and <a href=\"#Tenobia\">Queen Tenobia</a>&apos;s uncle (making Faile Tenobia&apos;s\n      cousin).  She left home to become a Hunter when her father sent her\n      younger brother off to fight while keeping her home; she finally decided\n      she&apos;d had enough of being at home and went to Illian.  While on her\n      quest to hunt for the Horn, she encountered <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Lan\">Lan</a>, and <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin</a> when they were\n      persuing <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> to Tear.  She was shocked to find out\n      that the Horn of Valere had already been <i>used</i>, much less found,\n      and even more surprised that Rand was the\n      <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>.\n      When she found this information out, Moiraine forbade her to\n      leave them, since if she did she could upset the balance of the world by\n      telling the wrong person that the <a href=\"#Dragon\">Dragon</a> was\n      Reborn.  Faile eventually developed feelings for Perrin, feelings which\n      he found he returned, and the two were married in Emond&apos;s Field shortly\n      after the Trolloc threat was secured.\n  "}]}
