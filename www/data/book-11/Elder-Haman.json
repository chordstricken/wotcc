Loial was not there, and they have not been able\n      to catch up with him.  Loial intentionally skipped Stedding Shantai on\n      his trips to the <i>stedding</i> so as to avoid Haman and his mother.\n      He is a prominent Speaker, and Loial&apos;s favorite role model.  Haman is\n      over three hundred years old.\n  "}]}
