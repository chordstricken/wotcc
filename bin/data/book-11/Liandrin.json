{"id":"Liandrin","name":"Liandrin","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue:  Embers Falling on Dry Grass","info":"Liandrin,\n      p. 38—Aes\n      Sedai of the Black Ajah, formerly of the Red.  She has light hair and a\n      face like a doll.  She grew up in Tarabon.  She led the group of\n      thirteen Aes Sedai who declared themselves Black Ajah and fled the White\n      Tower, murdering guards and even sisters in the process.  Liandrin was\n      Red Ajah before turning to the Black, but her oath to the Black was\n      sworn before even being raised to the Accepted (perhaps before she came\n      to the Tower), so it cannot really be said that she was ever Red Ajah at\n      all.  She was shielded by Moghedien for\n      attempting to Compel her and given to a very enthusiastic\n      Temaile to torture.  She has since been given to\n      Suroth as a da'covale.\n      See also\n      Alwhin.\n  "}]}
