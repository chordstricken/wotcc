  <li><a class="name"">Lord of Chaos</a>,
      p. 10 (ix)&mdash;Entity that
      controls all things in chaos.  It could refer to
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>,
      or chaos in general.  The phrase is &ldquo;let the Lord of Chaos
      rule,&rdquo; and comes from a chant in the Fourth Age.  It is
      also the subject of the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s command to the
      Forsaken:  &ldquo;Let the Lord of Chaos Rule.&rdquo;
<h3>Prologue:  The First Message</h3>
<img src="../chapters/snakewheel.gif" width="96" height="97" alt="Wheel of Time icon">
  <li><a class="name" name="Demandred">Demandred</a>,
      p. 13 (1)&mdash;One of
      the Forsaken.  He has a hawk-like nose and dark hair.  Second-best seems
      to be the story of his life.  He was born
      <a href="#Barid">Barid Bel Medar</a> one day after
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, and
      from the first day proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin's
      accomplishments, almost equal Lews Therin's strength, and almost equal
      him but never surpass him in everything.  He became one of the Light's
      greatest generals, once again second in command under Lews Therin.
      Demandred believed that he was Lews Therin's intellectual and military
      superior, and was furious when Lews Therin was chosen to lead the
      Light's forces over him during the War of the Shadow.  He developed a
      burning hatred of Lews Therin, and finally dedicated his life to the
      Shadow so he could finally better Lews Therin&mdash;he believed the
      Shadow would eventually win the war since Lews Therin was commanding the
      Light's armies, and that if he, Barid Bel Medar, had been chosen to
      command them, the Light would have prevailed.  When Demandred was freed
      from the Bore, he transferred his hatred of Lews Therin to the new
      recipient of his soul, <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>.  Demandred was
      recently told by the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> to lead his plan to
      convert or destroy Rand, and promised him to be
      <a href="#Naeblis">Nae'blis</a> if he succeeded.  Demandred's assumed
      identity and whereabouts are unknown.

      <a href="#Barid">Medar, Barid Bel</a>.
  <li><a class="name"">Great Lord of the Dark</a>,
      p. 14 (2)&mdash;Name
      that Forsaken and Friends of the Dark use for
      <a href="#Dark">Shai'tan</a>, the Dark One, claiming that to use his
      true name would be blasphemy.
      <i>See</i>
      <a href="#Dark">Shai'tan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Shaidar">Shaidar Haran</a>,
      p. 14 (3)&mdash;Myrddraal of special abilities who escorts the Chosen (i.e.,
      Forsaken) to the Pit of Doom to converse with the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.
      He is head and shoulders taller than all other Myrddraal, who
      are the height of an average man and all the same height.  His name
      means &ldquo;Hand of the Dark&rdquo; in the Old Tongue; most Myrddraal
      names come from the Trolloc tongue.  He is given special consideration;
      the ceiling of the entrance to the Pit of Doom does not brush his head
      as it does everyone else's.
  <li><a class="name" name="Rahvin">Rahvin</a>,
      p. 15 (5)&mdash;One
      of the Forsaken.  He was fond of using Compulsion, and was known for
      being a ladies' man&mdash;he always had a woman on his arm.  After being
      released from the Bore, he took up residence in Caemlyn as
      <a href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>, and used Compulsion to have
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> not only make him her advisor, but
      her lover as well.  He eventually planned to take over the country
      directly as the first ever King of Andor&mdash;he did his best to weaken
      support for Morgase, exiling her supporters and befriending those who
      opposed her, finally chasing her from the country as well.  Shortly
      after news of Morgase's death or at least abdication reached Cairhien,
      Rahvin was confronted and killed by <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> in
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i> with a weave of balefire strong enough to burn
      Rahvin's soul out of the pattern for hours, possibly days.

      <a href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Lanfear">Lanfear</a>,
      p. 15 (5)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose her name for
      herself, which means &ldquo;Daughter of the Night&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue.  She was born Mierin Eronaile, and
      was strong in the One Power.  She worked at the Collam Daan, the primary
      facility for research into the One Power.  Her final discovery there was
      what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that could be
      harnessed by men and women alike&mdash;this source turned out to be the
      emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s prison.  She and another Aes Sedai named
      Beidomon bored into that prison, creating what is now referred to as
      simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and
      leading to the War of the Shadow.  Around this time, Mierin had a
      relationship with <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who headed
      the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful and
      influential man she had found.  Lews Therin broke off the relationship
      when he found that she only wanted him for his power and authority and
      the possibility of power for herself through him.  Mierin never let go
      of him, and when he later met and married
      <a href="#Ilyena">Ilyena Moerelle</a>
      she tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split
      the two apart by any means.  Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to
      dedicate her soul to the Shadow, most likely to get back at Lews Therin
      for leaving her.  She declared as her territory the World of Dreams,
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>, using it to ends now unknown.  She transferred
      her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin's soul's new body,
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, after being freed from the Bore.  She
      first appeared to him as a young woman named Selene, disguising her
      appearance as a slightly less beautiful (but still stunning) woman.
      Almost a year later, Lanfear found that Rand had been
      &ldquo;unfaithful&rdquo; to her, and she tried to kill him.  Before she
      could, she was pushed through the twisted stone doorway
      <i>ter'angreal</i> leading to the lands of the Eelfinn by
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, and became trapped.  It is not known
      whether Lanfear is still alive.
  <li><a class="name" name="Asmodean">Asmodean</a>,
      p. 15 (5)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was born Joar Addam Nessosin in the
      then coastal city of Shorelle, a child prodigy in music and art.  He
      gave his life to the Shadow in exchange for the immortality he received,
      so he could study and perfect his music.  After being released from the
      Bore, he was coerced by <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> into coming with her,
      eventually to teach <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> to channel without killing
      himself.  Asmodean was drawn to Rhuidean and the stash of
      <i>angreal</i>, <i>ter'angreal</i>, and most especially the two white
      statue <i>ter'angreal</i> that linked the holder to the great
      <i>sa'angreal</i> buried near Cairhien and on Tremalking, which together
      could Break the World beyond repair.  He went there to obtain the male
      statue, but was thwarted by Rand, who severed his bonds to the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.  He then became Rand's teacher, and went
      into hiding from the rest of the Chosen, who would kill him on sight if
      they saw him.  He was killed by someone of yet unknown identity right
      after <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a> and Lanfear were killed/trapped.
  <li><a class="name" name="Graendal">Graendal</a>,
      p. 15 (5)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  A fleshy woman with curled red-gold hair.
      Before the War of the Shadow, she became the leading authority on
      diseases of the brain, and spent much of her life dealing with the
      insane, schizophrenic, and others well beyond the touch of Healing.  She
      was the best at subtle manipulations of the human mind that ever lived.
      After the Bore was drilled, she went through a change after she realized
      the world could never live up to her standards.  So she began dressing
      in the very way she once mocked, with low cut dresses that clung to her
      and left little to the imagination.  After being released from the Bore,
      Graendal took up residence in Arad Doman, capturing several members of
      the Royal Family to use as servants.  All of her servants are not only
      physically well shaped and good-looking, but also had power in their
      society before she captured them.  She includes in her collection the
      sister of the Domani king, two rulers from Shara, and other important
      figures.

      <a href="#Basene">Basene</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Moghedien">Moghedien</a>,
      p. 15 (5)&mdash;One of
      the Forsaken.  Her name means &ldquo;Spider&rdquo; in the Old Tongue.
      She always works and attacks from safety and will run unless she can do
      so.  She developed a command of <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i> that surpassed
      even <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a>'s mastery&mdash;in the real world,
      Lanfear was more powerful, but even she could not top Moghedien in the
      World of Dreams.  After being released from the Bore, Moghedien
      eventually found herself in Tanchico, in the Palace of the
      Panarch of Tarabon.  While there, she chanced upon
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a>, who was trying to save the
      Panarch at the time and take the seal on the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s
      prison from its hold in the Palace.  She and Nynaeve fought in
      a duel to the last, and Nynaeve managed to better Moghedien, much to the
      surprise of both of them.  She managed to escape Nynaeve's tied off
      shield, and on their next encounter, this one in <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>,
      she ripped <a href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</a>'s soul out of the World of
      Dreams after Birgitte almost killed her.  On her third encounter with
      Nynaeve, Nynaeve managed to trap Moghedien with an <i>a'dam</i>.
      Moghedien is currently bound by that <i>a'dam</i> in Salidar, disguised
      as <a href="#Marigan">Marigan</a>.

  <li><a class="name" name="Dragon">The Dragon</a>,
      p. 16 (5)&mdash;Name by which <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a> was known
      during the War of the Shadow.  His rebirth, the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, is now alive and fulfilling all of
      the prophecies set to accompany him.

  <li><a class="name" name="Naeblis">Nae'blis</a>,
      p. 16 (5)&mdash;The one who
      would stand only a step below the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>
      on the Day of Return, commanding all Darkfriends in the Dark
      One's name.  The position has been promised to
      <a href="#Demandred">Demandred</a> if he does well in his duties, but
      it is likely that <i>all</i> the Chosen were offered the position if
      they did well.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Dark">Shai'tan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a>,
      p. 16 (6)&mdash;Young woman from Emond's Field.  She was the Wisdom of her
      village, the youngest ever chosen in Emond's Field.  She left when
      four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> and <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>.  While the
      group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made
      several discoveries:  she could channel the One Power, and had already
      done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed
      feelings for al'Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned
      king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play,
      as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come.
      She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive
      during the Age of Legends could match her.  When she arrived in Tar
      Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a Novice, despite
      not being able to even <i>sense</i> the True Source unless angry, a
      result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability
      without teaching.  She was sent on a false mission by
      <a href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</a> on which she was almost leashed by the
      Seanchan as <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> was.  After she returned to the
      Tower, <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> sent her on a mission to hunt
      down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in
      Tanchico, she encountered <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a> and managed
      to better her in a duel of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two
      encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her,
      leashing her with an <i>a'dam</i> in <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>.  Nynaeve
      took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and
      <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a> while they were fighting each other, and at
      the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin
      to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could
      draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain
      control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve now keeps
      Moghedien under control with a modified <i>a'dam</i> in Salidar.
      Nynaeve wishes to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she
      thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and
      wants no part of it.  She is determined to Heal anything short of death,
      from severing to the wound on Rand's side.  Nynaeve felt bad when
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> died, because her first thought was not
      of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond.  She was not told
      that Lan's bond had been passed to another at the moment of her death,
      or who that person is.

      <a href="#Elayne">Trakand, Elayne</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Leane">Leane Sharif</a>,
      p. 16 (6)&mdash;A woman from Arad Doman with coppery skin.  Just as her family
      members were training her in the seductive ways of Domani women, Leane
      found that her life would take a different direction; she could channel
      <i>saidar</i>, and would do so with or without teaching.  She became an
      Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue Ajah, and was eventually raised to
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>.  During the coup led by
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</a> and
      <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a> that deposed Siuan,
      Leane was thrown in the dungeon and
      stilled.  Leane has turned to her seductive side to try to replace what
      she lost in stilling; she is out of practice, but does well enough.  She
      eventually convinced the Aes Sedai in Salidar to let her stay with them
      and maintain the network of eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as
      Keeper.

  <li><a class="name" name="Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>,
      p. 16 (6)&mdash;Born in
      Tear to a fisherman, she was sent to the White Tower on the
      first boat to leave after she discovered she had the ability to channel
      inborn, according to Tairen law.  As a novice, she was good friends with
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a>, and was present at
      <a href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</a>'s Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>.  After being raised to the shawl, she
      joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, and eventually came
      to lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being
      raised to the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  She was only thirty
      years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest
      Amyrlin to date.  When her lifelong connection to the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> was discovered, she and her
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a>,
      were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</a>.  Siuan hopes to regain some of
      her previous standing in the new Tower that has separated from
      Elaida&mdash;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to
      match, and she knows much that she thinks would be of use.  In one of
      her viewings, <a href="#Min">Min</a> saw that Siuan would have to remain
      close by to <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>&mdash;if she did not, both
      of them would die.  Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now
      realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the
      Salidar army.  She had a Warder named <a href="#Alric">Alric</a>, but he
      died when she was deposed.

  <li><a class="name" name="Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</a>,
      p. 17 (7)&mdash;The
      uncrowned king of Malkier, and formerly Warder to
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>.  He is quite tall, and does not get
      very emotional&mdash;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that
      he has been building for years.  His country, Malkier, was overrun by
      Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great
      Blight.  Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man
      war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He fought
      Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He was
      eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least
      changed its style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>,
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a>, <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, and
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he
      found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he
      was the last to notice it:  affection for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it,
      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them
      down without him even knowing they were there.  He loves her very much,
      whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise, loves
      him in return.  Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately
      transferred to another Aes Sedai, and he was last seen leaving the
      wagons near Cairhien to seek her out.

  <li><a class="name" name="Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>,
      p. 17 (7)&mdash;The <a href="#DH">Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>, now one of the
      Accepted.  She is the daughter of <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a>
      and her late husband, <a href="#Taringail">Taringail</a>, and sister to
      <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>.  She is also half-sister to
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>, although she would rather not be reminded of
      this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not
      really like him.  She has considerable potential in the One Power, and
      will most likely be the strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years or more,
      possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exception of
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.  She has
      red-gold curly hair.  During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne
      realized she loved <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, and told him how she
      felt; he felt similarly.  She had no idea at the time what
      <a href="#Min">Min</a> meant about &ldquo;having to share him,&rdquo; but
      now knows about Min's viewing of Rand with the three women's heads,
      indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and
      <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a>, and they with him.  Later, when she and
      Nynaeve had trouble with <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a>, Elayne ended
      up bonding <a href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</a> as her Warder (despite being

  <li><a class="name" name="Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>,
      p. 17 (8)&mdash;Formerly Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah, now raised to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> in Tar Valon.  She served as advisor
      to <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor for her entire reign,
      and led the coup that deposed <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> and
      placed her on the Amyrlin Seat in her place.  She distrusts anyone
      not of the Red Ajah (as most Reds do), and thinks she will never trust
      any member of the Blue Ajah again, even in the slightest.  Her
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> is
      <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a> of the White Ajah&mdash;she
      was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition
      of Siuan.  If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would
      not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <i>she</i> would
      have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan.  She
      sometimes has the Foretelling, but not all that often or that strongly.
      One of her Foretellings was that the Royal Family of Andor would play a
      crucial role in the Last Battle&mdash;this Foretelling occurred around
      the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached
      herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one
      to take the Lion Throne.  Another was to predict that
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> would shake the world on its very
      foundations&mdash;she constantly kicks herself for not doing something
      about him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the
      time.  The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly accurate, but the
      one about the Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time
      of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain.  It may have
      meant Morgase, <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>, <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>,
      and <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> (they have all had a large role to play
      in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old
      Royal Family, that of <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>,
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail</a>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as
      well.  After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of
      the Dragon Reborn.  Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan,
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>,
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>, <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and a few

  <li><a class="name" name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>,
      p. 17 (7)&mdash;Leader
      of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.  She in theory
      holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall of the Tower
      at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come
      if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip
      figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there.  The
      Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in
      her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must
      the vote to depose one.  Once chosen the Amyrlin is said to be &ldquo;of
      all Ajahs and none&rdquo;&mdash;all previous affiliations with Ajah are
      ignored (at least in theory).  The Ajahs get fairly equal numbers of
      Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions:  no Amyrlin has
      been raised from the Red Ajah since Bonwhin, who
      was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>'s day, except for
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>, the current Amyrlin
      Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of
      Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last the last five Amyrlins
      (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to
      the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the
      friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has
      a secretary of sorts, the <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the
      Amyrlin was raised from.  The office was held by
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah,
      until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
      Her successor was the leader of the coup, Elaida, raised
      from the Red Ajah.  Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the
      faction opposing Elaida plans to raise its own Amyrlin.

      <a href="#Tam">Tam al'Thor</a>
      and his wife <a href="#Kari">Kari</a> (until her death
      around the time Rand was five) in Emond's Field.  His real parents,

      <a href="#Laman">Laman</a>'s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named

      <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine Damodred</a>, the runaway
      <a href="#DH">Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>.  Tigraine gave birth to Rand
      on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy; &ldquo;born

      has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the
      sword Tam gave him while fighting <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a>.  He also
      has two dragons on his forearms, which he recieved in Rhuidean to
      designate him as the <a href="#Caracarn">Car'a'carn</a>, the Chief of
      Chiefs of the Aiel.  He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also
      <a href="#Dawn">He Who Comes With the Dawn</a>, the man prophesied to
      reunite the Aiel, and the <a href="#Coramoor">Coramoor</a>, the one

      obviously of equal strength), and is also <i>ta'veren</i>, the most
      strongly so since Lews Therin as well.  Lews Therin's voice has somehow
      found a new place inside of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice
      when Rand least expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or
      knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of
      <i>saidin</i> from him.  Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two
      other <i>ta'veren</i> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born
      within days (hours, even) of him named <a href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</a>
      and <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, who both grew up in Emond's
      Field as well.  Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and

      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>, and <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a>.
      He has already been

      raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn <i>Callandor</i>,
      and began conquering &ldquo;under the forgotten symbol,&rdquo; that of
      the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  He is working on having the
      &ldquo;spotless tower&rdquo; break and bend knee to him, as well.  He is
      the salvation of the entire world, and as the prophecy states, he
      <i>will</i> save the world&mdash;and Break it again.

      She married <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>, a prince of

      <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a> disappeared, Morgase made the best
      claim to succeed her, and married her widower to gain the support that
      would be gained by such action.  Taringail died when Elayne and Gawyn
      father; he died when they were young.  Morgase has since gone through
      several lovers, including <a href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</a>, a
      former court-bard; <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>, her First Prince
      of the Sword and Captain of the Guards; and most recently

      Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase
      herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power.  The
      Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the
      White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition
      alive.  She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being

      when she learned that the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> had taken

      fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could:

      and all would be well, but as royalty she believes she must work on her
      own and trust no one.  The entire world believes Morgase dead except for
      a select few, all of which are in Amadicia at the moment.

      Cairhien, she is <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>'s youngest
      half-sister, and <a href="#Laman">King Laman</a>'s niece.  She is
      considered short among her people, and the Cairhienin are already a
      short people.  When it was discovered that she had the ability to
      channel inborn, Moiraine went to Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai.  Just
      before being raised to the shawl, she and her friend
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> witnessed
      <a href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</a>'s Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>.  Moiraine and Siuan walked away from each
      other and did not speak to each other again (at least in public), but
      both held secret communication with each other and dedicated their lives
      to finding and guiding the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
      Moiraine found the young man she sought on Winternight in Emond's
      Field, a young man named <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, along with
      two more <i>ta'veren</i>, <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a> and two women with the spark of the
      Power inborn, <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a> and
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a>.  When Moiraine was shortly
      raised to the shawl, she met <a href="#Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</a>, the
      uncrowned King of Malkier, who was fighting alone against the Shadow in
      the Blight; she asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted.  She is
      very strong in the Power, stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai.  In
      the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken
      <a href="#Belal">Be'lal</a> with balefire, just before he would have
      killed Rand.  Later, after having an inkling of the future events from
      the testing <i>ter'angreal</i> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to
      push the Forsaken <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> through the twisted
      doorway <i>ter'angreal</i> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both
      her and Lanfear there.  It is unknown whether Moiraine lives on in the
      land off the Finn, or whether she is dead, but her bond with Lan has
      been severed, and other Aes Sedai consider her a legend, not only for
      discovering the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> but for killing or
      trapping two of the Forsaken as well.

      young man from Emond's Field.  He is <i>ta'veren</i>.  Along
      with his good friends, <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, he left home to escape the Trolloc
      attack on Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger
      from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which
      he carried with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger
      by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory
      sequence.  These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the
      twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three
      requests:  a foxhead medallion that protected him from women's
      channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of
      past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory.  Mat's <i>ta'veren</i>
      qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such
      as dice games&mdash;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if
      the dice are weighted.  He has found that battles are the ultimate form
      of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost
      every battle he fights quite decisively.  He has four sisters, including
      <a href="#Eldrin">Eldrin</a> and <a href="#Bode">Bodewhin</a>, who are
      16 and 17, respectively.  His father <a href="#Abell">Abell</a> is one
      of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World.  Mat has
      gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in
      case he is attacked&mdash;his collection would surprise anyone.  In the
      Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden
      of the Spear from the Shaido Clan.  However, she is not the
      <a href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>, who Mat is destined to
      marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders
      from her master among the Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill her to save his
      own skin, but regrets it deeply.  He has a scar along his neck from
      where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&mdash;which was also in accordance
      with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &ldquo;to die and live
      again.&rdquo; He currently heads an army called the Band of the Red
      Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old
      Manetheren, and serves in a way as Rand's personal general&mdash;this
      works well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even
      <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>, who has earned his good
      reputation as one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does not trust any
      Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off
      even to bathe.

      p. 21 (13)&mdash;A young man from Emond's Field.  He is
      <i>ta'veren</i>.  When he and <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> got separated
      from the rest of the group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight,
      Perrin met a man named Elyas Machera.  Elyas, a
      former Warder who found he could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover
      the same ability in himself.  Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like
      the wolves' eyes, and he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known
      to most as <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>, the World of Dreams) with them.
      Perrin is a childhood friend of fellow <i>ta'veren</i>
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> and <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      <a href="#Zarine">Zarine Bashere</a>, a Hunter for the Horn who took the
      name of <a href="#Faile">Faile</a> (which means &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in
      the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a Hunter for the Horn.
      The two are now married.  Perrin is a very large man&mdash;he was
      always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found
      as a child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got
      out of hand.  His size helps considerably when helping
      <a href="#Luhhan">Master Luhhan</a> on his forge, but sometimes gives
      others the impression that he is slow and stupid.  He is currently in
      the Two Rivers, helping to rebuild the area after the series of Trolloc
      attacks; he and his wife serve as Lord and Lady there, the first lord of
      the Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.

      p. 22 (15)&mdash;A young woman from Baerlon.  She has a special ability that
      few besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras around
      people, especially around Aes Sedai and Warders, that foretell their
      futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when
      she does, it <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of how and when.
      Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included
      herself:  he is destined to fall in love with three different women, one
      of which is herself.  She usually dresses in attire reserved for men;
      this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a
      miner.  However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she
      began to wear more traditionally feminine attire.  Min was in Tar Valon
      helping <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> with her viewings' information when
      Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and
      <a href="#Leane">Leane</a> from the dungeon.  She accompanied the two
      former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for
      Caemlyn with Salidar's embassy to Rand.

      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon</a> who created war in Ghealdan and surrounding
      nations before being captured and gentled by the Red Ajah.  He got loose
      during the chaos surrounding the deposing of
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>,
      and eventually was escorted out of Tar Valon by Siuan and
      her traveling companions.  Before he was gentled he was of considerable
      strength, and attracted quite a following of loyal soldiers.
      <a href="#Min">Min</a> still has viewings of him with a halo over his
      head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a figure of
      great power sometime in the future.  Recently, Logain has come forward
      with information that indicates the Red Ajah actually put him up to
      declaring himself the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, most likely
      with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would be less likely
      to be negatively critiqued than gentling a simple man who could

      p. 25 (19)&mdash;Former
      First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Queen's Guards under
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> in Andor.  He was appointed to the
      position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was exiled
      from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase's new advisor,
      <a href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>.  He moved to his private estates
      in rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women
      who unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, the former
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>;
      <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a>, the former
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>, and
      <a href="#Min">Min Farshaw</a>.  When these three made an oath to serve
      him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer
      curiosity to Salidar.  Once their, he discovered the true identity of
      the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken.  The Aes Sedai in
      Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the
      Amyrlin Seat from <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>, since he was the only
      commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help
      them.  He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel

      <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>,
      <a href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</a>, and
      <a href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</a>.  Although neither of them would admit
      it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to
      avoid another mistake like his relationship as
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>'s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for
      when she publicly shamed him years ago.

      <a href="#Bashere">Davram</a> and <a href="#Deira">Deira</a> Bashere,
      and their oldest surviving offspring.  Her two older brothers were
      killed, and when Davram sent her younger brother off to fight while
      keeping her at home, she ran away and swore the oath of a Hunter of the
      Horn in Illian.  When she became a Hunter, she renounced her old name,
      <a href="#Zarine">Zarine</a>, at first considering adopting the name
      &ldquo;Mandarb&rdquo;&mdash;she chose Faile when she found
      Mandarb was

      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a> while on her search for the Horn,
      who told her that the Horn had been found.  She was shocked, but even
      more so to find out that <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> was the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> and that both he and Perrin are
      <i>ta'veren</i>.  Faile stayed near Perrin, and finally accompanied him
      to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off the Trolloc attacks; the two
      were married shortly afterwards.  They were then proclaimed Lord and
      Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea, but Faile insisted they
      have a modest estate, and even servants, which she trained herself.  Her
      name means &ldquo;falcon&rdquo; in the Old Tongue; she is the falcon in
      <a href="#Min">Min</a>'s viewings of Perrin.  She is very protective of
      her husband, and does whatever she can to make sure he not so much as
      <i>looks</i> at another woman, even though he has no intention of doing
      so.

      competitions; Rand found that it is the way he can gain access to

      Rand as a newborn on the slopes of Dragonmount and took him home with
      him since Rand's mother was dead.  He was at Dragonmount as part of the
      Aiel War, which he left home to participate in when he was young.  He
      became an officer in the Illianer army, and even achieved Blademaster
      status, acquiring a heron-mark sword.  He married a woman from Caemlyn,
      <a href="#Kari">Kari</a>, who he met while stationed there.  When the
      Aiel War started, he fought Aiel all the way to Tar Valon and the Battle
      of the Shining Walls, where he found Rand on the mountain.  Tam and Kari
      raised Rand as their own son.  Tam always won the archery competitions
      (or came in second to <a href="#Abell">Abell Cauthon</a>), and passed

      from Stedding Shangtai.  He left the <i>stedding</i> at around age 90 to
      see the world; by Ogier standards, he is not yet old enough to leave the
      <i>stedding</i> without permission from the Council of Elders.  He is
      fond of books and history, and is an excellent Treesinger.  He is
      writing a book about his travels with the three <i>ta'veren</i> he

      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor and brother to
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>.  He will become First Prince of the Sword
      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that
      erupted after <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>'s deposition, Gawyn
      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders
      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back
      against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and
      <a href="#Leane">Leane</a> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself
      killed Hammar and Coulin,
      the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training,
      respectively, both of which are Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as
      good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them.  Gawyn does
      not know which party to support&mdash;he believes that anyone who
      opposes Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane is wrong, but at the
      same time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in
      leadership.  In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a> and
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a> side with those who broke from the
      Tower.  This is especially difficult since Gawyn has feelings for
      Egwene, feelings which she returns.  He believes the rumor that
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> killed his mother, and only refrains from
      killing him because Egwene made him promise not to.  His sign is a white
      boar.

      joined the Whitecloak army, Valda promoted him quickly because of his
      swordsmanship skill, claiming that he deserved recognition for his skill
      regardless of where he obtained it.  Valda thinks that
      <a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a>'s time as Lord Captain Commander of the
      Children of the Light is coming to an end&mdash;his skill as a military
      commander earned him the right to have the position as long as he has,
      but Valda thinks he is getting too old to be effective.  Valda plans to
      succeed him himself, but letting others know of this would undoubtedly

      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> back from Falme to Tar Valon.  Her Warder
      is named <a href="#Tomas">Tomas</a>.  She is more interested in current
      events than the average Brown; most of them could not care less what
      happened now, only what happened years ago.  She gave Egwene the twisted
      stone ring <i>ter'angreal</i> to assist her in Dreaming, and also once
      told <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> that there was really no need to keep
      her in the Tower until she learned to control her ability when she was a

      Verin went to the Two Rivers with <a href="#Alanna">Alanna</a>, they
      helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they
      brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including

      Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and
      decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town.  Verin is
      quite old&mdash;her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai
      means she is quite old indeed.

      handsome, even <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> has trouble blushing when
      she speaks to him, and Aes Sedai will often forsook their work to watch
      him practice (shirtless) in the sword yard.  Galad has much skill with
      the sword, and has acheived Blademaster status in practice if not in

      accompanied <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>'s deposition and joined
      <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>'s band of the Children of the Light.
      Because of his sword skill, Galad was promoted to an official position
      very quickly, and now controls his own small band of men.  He says he
      became a Whitecloak because it &ldquo;felt right.&rdquo;  He is
      extremely virtuous, and will do whatever he thinks is right regardless
      of who it hurts, even himself.  His sign is a winged silver sword, point

      do research at the Collam Daan, but was capable of teaching others.  She
      spent her years teaching until the Bore was opened and she dedicated her
      life to the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.  During the War of Power, she
      created &ldquo;schools&rdquo; for the children, at which she taught the
      children to spy on their parents and other such things.  After her
      release from the Bore, Mesaana set herself up in the White Tower, where
      she could control events without anyone suspecting she was behind them.
      She has been cooperating with <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> to some
      extent.
  <li><a class="name" name="Semirhage">Semirhage</a>,
      p. 56 (65)&mdash;One of
      the Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, she was one of the best
      Healers ever known.  She was called to all corners of the world Heal
      people that others thought beyond help.  However, she was sadistic; she
      exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for her
      Healing services.  Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from
      them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall
      of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of
      being severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her
      &ldquo;pleasures.&rdquo;   She chose instead to pledge for the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>, and created one of the most oppressive and
      pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power.
      After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark
      One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai.
      She also sent the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that
      <a href="#Sammael">Sammael</a> sent.  She is as tall as most men, and
      wears black most of the time&mdash;perhaps because

  <li><a class="name" name="Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      p. 57 (66)&mdash;The <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, Breaker of the World.  He
      was perhaps the greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes
      Sedai in recorded history.  During the War of the Shadow, he led the
      forces of the Light against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which
      re-sealed the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> back into his prison.
      Unfortunately, during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's
      touch, eventually killing his wife <a href="#Ilyena">Ilyena</a>, his
      children, and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of
      his blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:
      <a href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</a>.  After he had done this,
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> gave him his sanity back long enough
      for him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by
      drawing on <i>saidin</i> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the
      spot where he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near
      the present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of
      one of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for
      Lews Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but
      without Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to
      kill them.  Lews Therin's voice sometimes speaks inside
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>'s head, offering advice or sobbing over lost
      women, but is getting more and more vocal.  It even tries to seize
      control of <i>saidin</i> sometimes, much to Rand's fear.

      Hope&rdquo; in the Old Tongue.  After being released from the Bore, he
      took up residence on the Council of Nine in Illian as
      <a href="#Brend">Lord Brend</a>, and effectively rules the country.  He
      bears a battle scar that he got while fighting

      p. 77 (93)&mdash;One of
      the Forsaken.  He was the most powerful of the Forsaken, and during the
      Age of Legends he was a prominent philosopher and theologian named Elan
      Morin Tedronai.  He was never really bound inside the Bore, and led the
      hidden forces of the Shadow for the three thousand odd years from the
      end of the War of the Shadow to the present.  He took credit for such
      things as convincing the then insane
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>
      to kill everyone he loved, pursuading the dying
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a> not to accept the Aes Sedai
      Healing that might have saved his life, sending the Trollocs out of the
      Great Blight during the Trolloc Wars, and many other events in history
      that turned out poorly.  When the rest of the Forsaken were freed,
      Ishamael kept them away from each other's throats.  He confronted
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> at the Eye of the World where he was severed
      from the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s bonds; he confronted him again

      after Ishamael gave Rand a wound that he has not been able to recover
      from yet; and he confronted Rand in the Stone of Tear after he took
      <i>Callandor</i>.  Rand killed Ishamael after beating him sore by

      Spear, she was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because
      she had the ability to channel inborn.  She has green eyes, and is of
      age with <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>.  She is
      more than pretty with dark, reddish hair.  Aviendha is one of the three
      women in <a href="#Min">Min</a>'s viewing of Rand&mdash;she also saw
      that she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three
      rings in Rhuidean.  She denied her feelings for him at first, but when
      the wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became
      unavailable and she tried bathing as &ldquo;wetlanders&rdquo; did; Rand
      came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she
      panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway to Seanchan (she does not
      remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible, into the
      middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she decided she could not hide
      her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the night in
      each other's arms before coming back.  Aviendha says a similar incident
      will not occur, and punishes any Maiden who makes a crack about it (how
      they found out about something that occurred on the far side of the
      world on another continent is a different subject entirely).  She feels
      <i>toh</i> toward <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> for violating her trust,
      and denies her feelings for Rand until she can make it up to Elayne.
      She is often needled by the Maidens about liking Rand's eyebrows.

      given orders to locate the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> and
      narrowed it to three boys in Emond's Field.  While persuing them, he
      encountered the spirit of <a href="#Mordeth">Mordeth</a> in Aridhol, now
      called Shadar Logoth.  Mordeth attempted to consume Fain's soul, but
      instead the two souls merged, producing something more evil than either
      of them alone.  Fain no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has
      his own evil agenda.  He has used his Mordeth-derived powers to spread
      suspicion of <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> to
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</a>, the

      It is said, &ldquo;The look of the Eyeless is
      fear,&rdquo; from observing that a Myrddraal's look causes fear in the
      hearts of men.  Fain's look has that effect on Myrddraal&mdash;Fades
      feel the same fear of Fain as men feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called
      Ordeith, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak
      officer.  He is perhaps the most evil man alive.

      p. 277 (385)&mdash;King of Cairhien about twenty years ago.  His cutting of
      <i><a href="#Avendo">Avendoraldera</a></i> to make a throne unlike
      anything the world had ever seen precipitated the Aiel War.  The war
      continued for years until all nations united against the Aiel and even
      Tar Valon was threatened; the war finally ended when the Aiel killed
      Laman and took his sword.  Because of Laman's Pride, and his Sin, House
      Damodred lost the throne of Cairhien to House Riatin, and the city never
      again reached any of its former glory.  However, it also allowed
      Prophecy to be fulfilled: the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> was
      able to be born on the slopes of Dragonmount, born of a Maiden of the
      Spear but raised by the blood of the old nations.

      Before she was Keeper, she was counselor to
      <a href="#Mordrellen">Queen Mordrellen</a> of Andor,
      although she spent more time with her children.
      When she had the Foretelling, it was strong.  One of her Foretellings was
      to tell <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a> that she must become a Maiden of
      the Spear, or dire consequences would result; as it turned out, Tigraine
      needed to become <a href="#Shaiel">Shaiel</a>, the Maiden of the Spear
      who bore a son by <a href="#Janduin">Janduin</a> that grew up to be
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
      Another concerned Tigraine's brother <a href="#Luc">Luc</a>;
      she told him his fame, or his fate, lay in the Blight; he went into the
      Blight, and was never seen again.  Another extremely significant
      Foretelling occured at the moment of her own death:  in front of the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> and two Accepted named
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a> and
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, she felt the birth of the Dragon
      Reborn.  She slumped over into Moiraine's arms, dead, after the words
      were out of her mouth.

      Mordrellen.  I have picked this spelling because Modrellein is also

      which was given as a gift to the people of Cairhien from the Aiel.  The
      Cairhienin never knew exactly why the Aiel gave them such a gift, and
      almost five hundred years later it was almost forgotten that it
      <i>was</i> a gift from them.  The tree, which grew in the center of the
      city of Cairhien, was cut down by
      <a href="#Laman">King Laman Damodred</a> twenty years ago,

      through the Waste they were allowed, was terminated after Laman's
      Sin&mdash;the Aiel now refer to all Cairhienin as

      them.

      Unlike his depiction in the stories (which say he is as handsome as
      Birgitte is beautiful), Gaidal Cain is one of the ugliest men that
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> has ever seen.  Just being around him
      makes Nynaeve uncomfortable.  Before being ripped out of
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>, Birgitte mentioned that she had not seen Gaidal
      around for some time, indicating that he has been spun out into the
      Pattern again.  She fears she will never see him again.

      p. 706 (995)&mdash;The Dark One,
      source of all evil, complete opposite of the
      <a href="#Creator">Creator</a> in every way.  At the moment of Creation,
      the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul.  This prison
      kept the Dark One from touching the world until it was bored into by
      humans during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore, allowed
      the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of
      war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free the Dark One
      completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by
      some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of
      important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark
      One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the
      most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War of the Shadow
      did not end until <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the Dragon,
      and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the
      Dark One back into his prison.  At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan
      lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting
      <i>saidin</i> itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male
      Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These
      seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the
      Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world.  These
      seals were scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the
      Breaking of the World.  In order of when they were found, they were
      placed:  (1) At the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); (2) in
      the hands of Bayle Domon, later pilfered by
      High Lord Turak of the Seanchan (broke at the
      battle of Falme), (3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection
      (broken at the battle at Falme); (4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of
      Tear (still intact); (5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broke
      enroute to Salidar); (6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and (7) Found
      by <a href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</a> (still intact).  Despite being made
      of <i>cuendillar</i>, the three that remain unbroken can be cut with a
      knife and would break by a fall from a table.  The Dark One is also
      referred to by other Euphemisms, including Sightblinder, Lord of the
      Grave, Father of Lies, Grassburner, Leafblighter, Heartsbane, Soulsbane,
      Lord of the Twilight, Father of Storms, Shepherd of the Night, and
      (among Darkfriends) Great Lord of the Dark.
