      of the prophecies set to accompany him.

  <li><a class="name" name="Niall">Lord Captain Commander Pedron Niall</a>,
      p. 13 (1)&mdash;Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light.  He
      has dark eyes and graying hair.  He is the most powerful man among the
      Children, and even posesses king-like powers in Amadicia, where the
      Whitecloaks are based.
  <li><a class="name" name="Byar">Jaret Byar</a>,
      p. 13 (1)&mdash;Officer among the Children of the Light with dark, deep-set
      eyes and a scraggly face.  He comes to
      <a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a> with news of the battle at Falme.
      According to Niall, he is not very imaginative.
  <li><a class="name" name="Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>,
      p. 14 (2)&mdash;According to the <i>Karaethon Cycle</i>, the Prophecies of the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, the Dragon Reborn is the man who is the Rebirth of
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      the man known as the Dragon during
      the War of the Shadow.  Over the years, many men have claimed to be the
      Dragon Reborn, even men who could not channel.  The true Dragon has been
      Reborn in a young man named <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, a shepherd
      from Emond's Field.

  <li><a class="name" name="Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      p. 14 (2)&mdash;The <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, Lord of the Morning,
      Breaker of the World.  He was
      perhaps the most influential man who ever lived, and the most
      powerful Aes Sedai ever.  He led the strike which resealed the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> back into his prison, ending the Age
      of Legends and beginning the Time of Madness.  Unfortunately, Lews
      Therin was driven insane along with the rest of the Hundred
      Companions with whom he resealed the prison; he went mad and
      killed everyone he loved as well as anyone who carried so much as
      one drop of his blood.  For this reason, he was given the name
      Kinslayer, and his name is generally associated with evil, especially
      among the uneducated.  He is especially despised by the Whitecloaks,
      the &ldquo;Children of the Light,&rdquo; who by their very name should be
      serving him.  It is unfortunate that one of the greatest men who ever
      lived is as feared and despised as he is.

  <li><a class="name" name="Bornhald">Lord Captain Geofram Bornhald</a>,
      p. 15 (3)&mdash;Lord Captain of the thousand or so Whitecloaks who died at
      Falme.  He died with his men.  He was the commander of the troops who
      captured <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> and <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>; when Perrin killed
      some of his men, Bornhald vowed to take Perrin back to Amador to be
      hanged.  Despite this, he may have been one of the few Whitecloaks who
      saw beyond the propaganda of the Children, using his own wisdom to judge
      people instead of insisting everyone not in white cloaks was in league
      with the Shadow.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Dain">Bornhald, Dain</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Creator">The Creator</a>,
      p. 15 (3)&mdash;The entity who created the world; in short, God.  He has a
      strict policy of not directly interfering with worldly events, instead
      using a &ldquo;Chosen One&rdquo; to do what must be done.  The last
      &ldquo;Chosen One&rdquo; was <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>;
      the current one is <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>.

      <a href="#Dark">Shai'tan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Dain">Dain Bornhald</a>,
      p. 16 (4)&mdash;Son of <a href="#Bornhald">Geofram Bornhald</a>.
      <a href="#Byar">Jaret Byar</a> was sent to tell him how his father
      had died.  Dain was the leader of the band of Whitecloaks that
      stopped <a href="#Verin">Verin</a>, <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>,
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>, <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>,
      and <a href="#Hurin">Hurin</a> near Tar Valon.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Bornhald">Bornhald, Geofram</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Valda">Lord Captain Eamon Valda</a>,
      p. 16 (4)&mdash;Officer of the Children of the Light.  He commands
      <a href="#Dain">Dain Bornhald</a>.  He is stationed near Tar Valon.
      <a href="#Bornhald">Geofram Bornhald</a> questioned his motives and
      worried that Dain would follow his orders blindly.
  <li><a class="name" name="Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>,
      p. 17 (4)&mdash;Young man from Emond's Field.  He is <i>ta'veren</i>.
      <a href="#Byar">Byar</a> believes
      it was Perrin who betrayed <a href="#Bornhald">Bornhald</a>'s
      legion to the Seanchan.  Perrin is a large man,
      and very cautious&mdash;he
      found it was easy to forget how big he was and really hurt other
      children when he was young, so he is careful not to act too quickly.
      He discovered that he can talk to wolves while he and
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> were separated from the rest of the
      group between Aridhol and Caemlyn, when he encountered
      <a href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</a>.  Elyas helped him learn about
      his ability, but not how to keep from losing his human side in the
      process.  The wolves refer to him as
      &ldquo;<a href="#Bull">Young Bull</a>.&rdquo;
      He carries a curved battle ax and recently acquired a blacksmith's
      hammer which he sometimes carries in place of the ax.
      Perrin also possesses the ability
      to enter what he calls the &ldquo;Wolf Dream,&rdquo; which is actually
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>, the World of Dreams.  In the Wolf Dream, Perrin
      can communicate with all wolves, living or dead.

  <li><a class="name" name="Taim">Mazrim Taim</a>,
      p. 18 (5)&mdash;False
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a> from Saldaea.  He can channel the One
      Power, and is of considerable strength.  At last report, Aes Sedai were
      on their way to gentle him.  He was captured by a mob after a blinding
      flash knocked him senseless at the moment <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>
      declared himself as the true <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.

      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Carridin">Jaichim Carridin</a>,
      p. 18 (5)&mdash;Inquisitor of the Hand of the Light; a Questioner.
      This band is much like the Spanish Inquisition,
      using torture to extract what it already knows to be the truth from
      its subjects.  This position is extremely ironic, considering the
      fact that the chief role of the Questioners is to find
      Darkfriends&mdash;Carridin himself is a Darkfriend,
      with orders to kill <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> whatever the
      cost.  If he fails, one member of his family will be killed by a
      Myrddraal every month until Rand lies dead.
  <li><a class="name" name="Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>,
      p. 20 (7)&mdash;Name by which <a href="#Artur">Artur Paendrag Tanreall</a>
      was known during his conquest of the world.
      <i>See</i>
      <a href="#Artur">Paendrag Tanreall, Artur</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Ordeith">Ordeith</a>,
      p. 25 (11)&mdash;<a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a>'s foremost servant;
      he also serves as his advisor.  He is a bony man with a &ldquo;huge beak
      of a nose.&rdquo;  He is the only person (besides
      Niall himself) who knows of a secret passage into Niall's chamber,
      which Niall suspects he uses for eavesdropping.  Ordeith is actually
      a fake name&mdash;the man he really is is more dangerous than any other
      man alive.  The name &ldquo;Ordeith&rdquo; means &ldquo;Wormwood&rdquo;
      in the Old Tongue.
  <li><a class="name" name="Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>,
      p. 26 (11)&mdash;Young
      man from Emond's Field.  It is his picture that appears in the
      drawings that <a href="#Niall">Niall</a> receives.  These drawings
      depicted the battle over the skies of Falme, in which Rand battled
      <a href="#Baal">Ba'alzamon</a>.  Rand is probably the most strongly
      <i>ta'veren</i> individual who ever lived, with the possible exception
      of <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>.  Rand can channel the One
      Power with incredible strength, and is destined to fight the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> in the last battle&mdash;he is the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Rand is not convinced of his
      destiny, and plans to &ldquo;test&rdquo; it by going to Tear to see if he
      can take <i>Callandor</i>, the Sword That is Not a Sword, the Sword That
      Cannot Be Touched.

  <li><a class="name" name="Mat">Matrim (Mat)  Cauthon</a>,
      p. 26 (12)&mdash;Young man from Emond's Field.  He is <i>ta'veren</i>, and has
      considerable luck with random events, such as dice games.  He went
      to Tar Valon to be separated from the dagger he carries,
      a dagger tainted with the evil of Shadar Logoth.

      to spite him.  It is the literal meaning of the name
      &ldquo;Ordeith.&rdquo;

  <li><a class="name" name="Great">Great Lord of the Dark</a>,

      They claim that using his true name would be blasphemy.

  <li><a class="name" name="Luhhan">Haral Luhhan</a>,
      p. 32 (18)&mdash;Blacksmith of Emond's Field.  He was
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>'s mentor at the forge.
      He is a very large, well-built man,
      perfect for striking at the forge.

      <a href="#Perrin">Aybara, Perrin</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a>,
      p. 32 (18)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  From even before she became
      a full sister, she dedicated her life to finding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
      She was a good friend of <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> when she
      was in training.  Moiraine was able to track the whereabouts of the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> to a small village in western
      Andor, Emond's field, where she narrowed the list of candidates to
      three young men, all of whom were <i>ta'veren</i>, who were born
      within days of each other.  She guided these three away from
      Emond's Field, until an encounter at the Eye of the World revealed
      which of the three was truly the one:  <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>,
      who she found was actually born near Tar Valon on the
      slopes of Dragonmount and brought to Emond's Field by his
      adoptive father, <a href="#Tam">Tam</a>.  Moiraine bears much
      importance in the White Tower, and is involved in actions which
      many of her fellow sisters would think to be treason, actions she
      would most likely be stilled for if their full extent were known.
      These sisters do not understand just how important the Dragon
      Reborn actually is.

      soldier, chief among those with <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a>.  He
      is missing his left eye and has a long scar down the left side
      of his face.  He has a very foul tongue, a habit of which

  <li><a class="name" name="Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</a>,
      p. 42 (26)&mdash;Uncrowned
      king of Malkier, a nation now swallowed by the Great Blight.  For years,
      he fought a one-man war against the Shadow in the Blight, until being
      bonded as a Warder by <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>.  Lan is one of
      the best Warders, but he is very hard and stubborn, and is thus hard for
      Aes Sedai to deal with.  He keeps a stone countenance, never revealing
      his true feelings to anyone&mdash;although sometimes he cannot hide his
      feelings for <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.

      terrain they had to cover, but she managed.
  <li><a class="name" name="Min">Elmindreda (Min)  Farshaw</a>,
      p. 43 (27)&mdash;Young woman from Baerlon.  She
      dresses in men's clothing, a habit she picked up while
      assisting her father in his mine.  She has dark eyes and dark
      hair.  She has a special talent, that of seeing images or auras
      around people that predict their futures.  Min does not think the
      ability is all that great, since her viewings often forecast
      death, pain, or other unpleasant circumstances for those they
      represent.  One of her viewings surprised her:  she is destined
      to fall in love with <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, but is
      also destined to &ldquo;share&rdquo; him with two other women.

      She is seven years older than <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>. <!--p. 487-->
      She was the Wisdom before leaving home.  She was appointed the
      Wisdom at a very young age, mostly as a result of being able
      to &ldquo;listen to the wind&rdquo; and because of her ability to heal
      people.  She did not know it at the time, but she now knows
      that these abilities are manifestations of her ability to
      touch <i>saidar</i>, the female half of the True Source.  She
      has considerable potential, more than any Aes Sedai in recent
      times, possibly since the Age of Legends, but that potential
      is blocked&mdash;<wbr>Nynaeve had to learn control of the Power by
      herself, without Aes Sedai guidance, and to protect herself
      created a block to her channeling which only comes down when
      she is angry or using her medicines.

      her life, since three out of four women who have to learn the

      dark eyes.  It was generally expected that she would marry

      In order to build his new throne, Laman cut down
      <i><a href="#Avendo">Avendoraldera</a></i>, a Chora tree that grew
      in the center of the city of Cairhien.  This act, known as Laman's Sin,
      prompted three clans of the Aiel to cross the Spine of the World and
      avenge the death of the tree by taking his life.  The tree had been a
      gift from the Aiel in gratitude for the hospitality the people of
      Cairhien had displayed to them in the past.  It is unknown whether
      Laman knew of the significance of <i>Avendoraldera</i>, or of the
      reason the Aiel allowed the people of his kingdom to cross the Waste.
      The fact that he cut the tree down and brought the Aiel over the
      Dragonwall allowed Prophesy to be fulfilled and the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> to
      be born on the slopes of Dragonmount, born of the ancient blood (Aiel)
