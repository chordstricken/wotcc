      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, and
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>.  After
      leaving the Two Rivers with <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> and
      traveling to the Eye of the World, Rand discovers not only that he is
      able to channel the One Power, but that he is the

      uncrowned king of Malkier, a nation now swallowed by the Great Blight.

      how to stand up to the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> and other
      people of importance that he will encounter in the future.  He always
      tries to act as stolid and unemotional as possible, but he has taken
      a liking to <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a>, and his feelings
      for her occasionally allow Moiraine to get in under his guard.

      the Illianer Companions during one of the wars with Tear, and then as an
      officer in the army against the Aiel in the Aiel War.  During his
      tenure as an officer, he attained Blademaster status and was awarded a
      heron-mark sword.  During the Battle of the Shining Walls, he found an
      infant boy on the slopes of Dragonmount.  His mother was dead, and Tam
      could not let the child freeze to death.  He and his wife, a woman from
      Caemlyn named <a href="#Kari">Kari</a>, returned with the child (which
      they named <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>) to Emond's Field.  It is unknown

      p. 5&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Blue Ajah who has dedicated her life to finding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  She came to the Two Rivers and
      found three young men who she thought may be the one she sought, and
      was correct.  She is bonded to <a href="#Lan">Lan</a> and is an old
      friend of the <a href="#Siuan">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  Due to the nature of
      her life's work, she has not been back to the White Tower in a long
      time.

      p. 7 (6)&mdash;A young man from Emond's Field, and a good friend of
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>.  He likes to gamble, and has
      considerable luck with random events, such as dice games.  When he was
      traveling from Emond's Field to the Eye of the World, he picked up a
      dagger from Aridhol, more commonly known as Shadar Logoth, which was
      tainted with evil.  He was partially healed by
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, but the dagger was stolen before
      his link with it could be completely broken.  If it is not broken
      soon, Mat will waste away and die.

      p. 7 (6)&mdash;A young man from Emond's Field, and a good friend of
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> and <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>.
      While he was staying with <a href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</a>, he
      found that he has the ability to talk to wolves.  Once this ability
      manifested itself, his eyes took on the yellowish color of wolves'
      eyes.  He is bigger than most people, a fact which greatly helped him
      as a blacksmith's apprentice, but the fact that he often underestimates
      his strength has caused him to be very cautious.  He carries a large
      battle ax at his belt.

      Field prior to leaving to help four members of her village return home
      after they left with <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>.  Moiraine
      tells her that she has the ability to channel the One Power with
      great strength, and that it is this ability that allows her to
      &ldquo;listen to the wind.&rdquo;  While traveling with Moiraine and
      company, Nynaeve develops feelings for <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>.  He
      shares her feelings, but is unable to act on them due to his duties as a
      Warder and those to his fallen homeland.

      p. 7&mdash;A young woman from Emond's Field.  She was all but promised to
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> from a young age, but they both feel somewhat
      uncomfortable now that they know that Rand is the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
      Like <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, Egwene is told that she can
      channel the One Power, and that she has the capability to be the
      strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years (besides Nynaeve).  She is
      on her way to Tar Valon to become a novice in the White Tower.

  <li><a class="name" name="DH">Daughter-Heir (of Andor)</a>,
      p. 10 (9)&mdash;By Andoran tradition,
      the oldest daughter of the Queen succeeds her on the
      Lion Throne.  No man is allowed to be King, at least not as more than a
      figurehead.  The previous Daughter-Heir,
      <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>, disappeared over twenty years
      ago; the current Daughter-Heir is <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>.
      It is also traditional for the Daughter-Heir and her oldest brother
      (who will become First Prince of the Sword when she becomes Queen) to
      train in Tar Valon, but Elayne is the first Daughter-Heir, indeed, the
      first ruler of any kind in recent memory, to actually have enough
      ability to channel that she will become Aes Sedai.

      p. 10 (9)&mdash;The woman
      who leads the Aes Sedai, equivalent in power to a king or
      queen, with the additional influence of being Aes Sedai.  Elected for
      life by the Hall of the Tower, the highest council among the Aes Sedai
      consisting of 21 Sitters, three from each of seven Ajahs.  The Amyrlin
      is considered to be &ldquo;of all Ajahs and of none&rdquo;; all of her
      status in her previous Ajah is ignored.  The position is currently held
      by <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah.

  <li><a class="name" name="Agelmar">Lord Agelmar Jagad</a>,
      p. 14&mdash;Lord of Fal Dara.  He is perhaps the only person in Fal Dara
      that <a href="#Elansu">Elansu</a> cannot bully into doing what she
      wants him to do&mdash;and even he yields more often than not.  His sign
      is three running red foxes.

  <li><a class="name" name="Alwyn">Alwyn al'Van</a>,

      <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>, and <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> on their
      journey.  He saved Rand's life by facing a Myrddraal long enough for
      Rand to escape, and is presumed to be dead at the hands of that
      Myrddraal.  However, Moiraine believes him to be alive, and one of
      his friends once remarked that he would believe Thom dead when he saw
      his corpse.

      from Stedding Shangtai, son of <a href="#Arent">Arent</a> son of
      <a href="#Halan">Halan</a>.  He is quite fond of books.  Loial is about
      ninety years old, which (by Ogier standards) is hardly old enough to
      leave the <i>stedding</i> alone.
  <li><a class="name" name="Cenn">Cenn Buie</a>,
      p. 32 (29)&mdash;Member
      of the Village Council of Emond's Field.  He is quite old, and quite

      most likely a Darkfriend, or at least corrupted by Fain, and allowed

      p. 43 (39)&mdash;Spirit of
      the advisor to the last leader of the city of Aridhol who used evil as
      a weapon against the Shadow.  Eventually that evil destroyed Aridhol
      and everyone who lived there, tainting the very ground it rested on.
      Mordeth is always on the lookout for innocent passers-by that come into
      Shadar Logoth (the new name for Aridhol)&mdash;it is said that if he ever
      accompanied anyone to the city walls, he would be able to consume that
      person's soul.  This happened in the case of
      <a href="#Fain">Padan Fain</a></A>,
      but Mordeth was unable to completely consume Fain's soul.
      Instead, Fain's evil from the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> combined with
      Mordeth's evil to create something that was more evil than either of
      them alone, possibly more evil than the Dark One himself.

      a Chora tree that grew in the center of the city of Cairhien.
      This act, known as Laman's Sin,
      prompted three clans of the Aiel to cross the Spine of the World and
      avenge the death of the tree by taking his life.  The tree had been a
      gift from the Aiel in gratitude for the hospitality the people of

      Laman knew of the significance of <i>Avendoraldera</i>, or of the
      reason the Aiel allowed the people of his kingdom to cross the Waste.
      The fact that he cut the tree down and brought the Aiel over the

      described by <a href="#Loial">Loial</a> as &ldquo;perfect human beauty in
      face and form.&rdquo;  She is very knowledgeable about the Age of
      Legends, to the extent that Rand is suspicious that the amount of
      information she knows may not be available even in the Royal Library in
      Cairhien.  She also knows about the Oneness, what Rand calls the Void.
      She also knows exactly how to use the Portal Stones, even though she
      insists she does not.  As with many characters, it is likely that Selene
      is hiding her true identity.
