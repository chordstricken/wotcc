      p. ix&mdash;The <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>,
      <a href="#Morning">Lord of the Morning</a>,
      <a href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</a>, Breaker of the
      World.  He is a tall man just into his middle years.
      He was handsome once, but now he has more white hair than brown,
      and his face is lined from strain and worry.  He has dark eyes.
      Known as the Dragon during the War of the Shadow.
      He killed his entire family in the madness that seized him
      after resealing the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s prison.

      p. ix&mdash;Wife of <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>.  She has
      blonde hair.  She was called &quot;Sunhair.&quot;  She died along with
      her children when her insane husband killed them, and her.

      p. x&mdash;Source
      of all evil, antithesis of the <a href="#Creator">Creator</a>.  He was
      imprisoned by the Creator at the moment of Creation at Shayol Ghul.
      This prison was bored into during the Age of Legends, which led to the
      War of the Shadow, the Time of Madness, the Breaking of the World, and
      the end of the Age of Legends.  Since naming him by his true name brings
      ill fortune or disaster, many euphemisms exist, including Father of
      Lies, Grassburner, Heartsbane, Heartfang, Leafblighter, Lord of the
      Grave, Shepherd of the Night, Sightblinder, and Soulsbane.  He is most
      commonly referred to as simply &ldquo;The Dark One.&rdquo;

      p. x&mdash;Man who appears to <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a> shortly
      after he killed his entire family.  He Healed Lews Therin from his
      madness, allowing him to finally realize what he had done.  Elan Morin
      is now known as <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a>, which means
      &ldquo;<a href="#Betrayer">Betrayer of Hope</a>&rdquo; in the Old Tongue.
      He claims to follow a &ldquo;different power&rdquo; now, that of the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> himself.  He was once humbled by Lews
      Therin in the Hall of Servants, and defeated by him at the gates of
      Paaren Disen.  However, Lews Therin fled and killed himself before
      Elan Morin could do with him as he had planned.

      p. xi&mdash;Name given to <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>
      during the
      War of the Shadow.  He did not like the name.  The name is now
      associated with evil, since Lews Therin killed his entire family in his
      madness at the end of his life.  It is said the Dragon will be Reborn at
      mankind's greatest hour of need to save the world&mdash;and Break it

<h3>Ravens</h3>

  <li><a class="name" name="Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>,
      p. 5 [1]&mdash;A nine-year-old girl from Emond's Field.
      She is the daughter of <a href="#Bran">Bran</a>, the Mayor
      of Emond's Field, and his wife <a href="#Marin">Marin</a>.
      Egwene has four older sisters;
      <a href="#Berowyn">Berowyn</a>,
      <a href="#Alene">Alene</a>,
      <a href="#Elisa">Elisa</a>, and
      <a href="#Loise">Loise</a>;
      and resents them at times for treating her as the baby of the family.
      Egwene dislikes dogs, and is not considered big for her age.
      She loves her village and its customs, but she is beginning to wonder
      what the world outside it is like.  After reaching the age of eighteen,
      Egwene earns the right to wear her hair in a braid for the first time,
      the Two Rivers symbol of womanhood.  She has large brown eyes.  She
      and <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> have been all but Promised to each other since
      she was nine; this makes him uncomfortable.  <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>
      discovered that Egwene has the ability to Listen to the Wind, a Talent
      that all Wisdoms claim to possess but few actually do.

  <li><a class="name" name="Ahan">Kenley Ahan</a>,
      p. [2]&mdash;A boy from
      Emond's Field in the Two Rivers.  He is about two years older than
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, making him eleven years old.
  <li><a class="name" name="Aynal">Widow Aynal</a>,
      p. [2]&mdash;Woman for which
       Widow Aynal's Meadow is named.  No one remembers which Aynal widow it
       was actually named for; the meadow has been called that as long as
       anyone can remember.
  <li><a class="name" name="Berowyn">Berowyn al'Vere</a>,
      p. [3]&mdash;Oldest of
      the five daughters of <a href="#Bran">Bran</a> and
      <a href="#Marin">Marin al'Vere</a>; <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>'s
      oldest sister.  She has been allowed to wear her hair in a braid, the
      Two Rivers symbol of adulthood for women, since she was sixteen years
      old.  Berowyn was married, but her husband and her newborn child
      died in the epidemic of breakbone fever that struck the village;
      the same epidemic threatened Egwene's life as well.
      She has since treated Egwene as though she were Berowyn's own child,
      mooning over her as if she were the last thing left in her life.

  <li><a class="name" name="Ewin">Ewin Finngar</a>,
      p. 5 [4]&mdash;Boy from
      Emond's Field.  He is very young&mdash;seven or eight years
      old&mdash;but he already has a reputation for filching sweets when no
      one is looking.  He is about six years younger than <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Corin">Corin Ayellin</a>,
      p. 36 [4]&mdash;Slim woman
      from Emond's Field.  She has a thick gray braid that hangs down as far
      as her hips.  She bakes the best sweets in Emond's Field, possibly in
      the Two Rivers&mdash;<a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> asserts that her own
      mother's are better, but even her mother admits that Mistress Ayellin's
      are the best.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Dav">Ayellin, Dav</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>,
      p. 4 [4]&mdash;A boy of about thirteen years of age from Emond's field.
      He is one of the tallest boys in Emond's Field,
      even taller than <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, one of his two best friends
      (though since Rand is not yet finished growing, it is possible he will
      catch Perrin eventually).
      He is also good friends with <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>, who often
      gets Perrin and Rand into trouble.
      He has curly hair, and is very stocky and generally big.
      He is very shy and laughs seldomly; <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>
      perceives him to be dense, though she is starting to realize he may
      simply be overly contemplative and careful.
      His parents recently arranged to have him apprenticed to
      <a href="#Luhhan">Haral Luhhan</a>, the blacksmith of Emond's Field.
      Perrin has two younger sisters, <a href="#Adora">Adora</a> and
      <a href="#Deselle">Deselle</a> (eight and three, respectively) and one
      younger brother, <a href="#Paetram">Paetram</a>, who is an infant.
      As an adult, Perrin ended up about half a head shorter than Rand, and
      also a fair bit shorter than Mat as well.  He is still larger of build
      than both of them, however, which works well for a blacksmith.

  <li><a class="name" name="Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>,
      p. 1 [4]&mdash;Shepherd from
      the Two Rivers.  He is the second tallest boy in Emond's Field, and may
      soon be taller than his friend <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> as well.
      He has grey eyes and reddish hair, both of which are unheard of in the
      Two Rivers.  His mother died when Rand was five;
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> thinks he envies boys that have mothers.
      Rand is good friends with <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>
      and <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>.
      As a twenty year-old, Rand is about a head taller than Perrin,
      and taller than Mat as well.  Rand and the Mayor's daughter,
      Egwene, have been all but Promised to each other since they were both
      young; this is often the subject of ridicule by Mat and Perrin.

      She seemed upset that her mother and father were detaining her at the
      forge when she could have been playing with her friends&mdash;she will
      not be asked to carry water for another year.  She tells
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, &ldquo;everybody says she'll marry
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>&rdquo;; Egwene was aware that her
      parents and perhaps Rand's father thought this, but not that
      <i>everyone</i> thought so&hellip;.

      strains his shirt.  He is the tallest man in the Two Rivers.
      Master Luhhan has recently aquired a new apprentice in
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>.  His wife,

      considers her a &ldquo;ninny.&rdquo;  She likes to stare and make

  <li><a class="name" name="Mat">Matrim (Mat)  Cauthon</a>,
      p. 4 [6]&mdash;Boy of
      about 13 years of age from Emond's Field.  He has brown eyes.
      Mat is known for his practical jokes and other mischief,
      often getting his best friends in trouble with him.
      He is good friends with <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, though he seems to have a contest
      going with <a href="#Dav">Dav Ayellin</a> as to who can get the other
      into the most trouble.  He has two younger sisters,
      <a href="#Bode">Bodewhin</a> and <a href="#Eldrin">Eldrin</a>.
      As a twenty year-old, Mat has grown to be one of the tallest men in
      the Two Rivers.  He is still known for his practical jokes and other

      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> only calls him &ldquo;Master Coplin&rdquo;
      in public, to be polite&mdash;in her own head, he is simply Dag Coplin,

      She loves to read, and ignores
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> unless Egwene is presently reading a book

  <li><a class="name" name="Barran">Doral Barran</a>,
      p. 268 [7]&mdash;Wisdom of Emond's Field.  She is the oldest woman in Emond's
      Field, possibly in the entire Two Rivers.
      She is white-haired and frail, though still
      clear-eyed and not stooped at all.  Her last apprentice died of a
      mysterious illness that she could not cure.  She currently has another
      apprentice, <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a>, who has been
      studying under her for three years.

  <li><a class="name" name="Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a>,
      p. 7 [7]&mdash;Young
      woman from Emond's Field.  She has brown hair and eyes, and is quite
      slender.  She has been studying under <a href="#Barran">Doral Barran</a>,
      the Wisdom of Emond's Field, for about three years.  Many people in the
      village think she is too young to be apprenticed to a Wisdom, and that
      Mistress Barran should have chosen someone years older when Nynaeve's
      predecessor died mysteriously.  Nynaeve is a very quick learner, and
      has been allowed to braid her hair for a year now.  She has developed
      the ability to sense <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>'s presence without
      seeing her since the end of the breakbone fever epidemic.  Mistress
      Barran seems to have caught on to some of Nynaeve's abilities&mdash;she
      seemed disappointed that the wound Nynaeve was bandaging did not seem
      more healed than it was when she started.
      After Mistress Barran's death, Nynaeve herself became the Wisdom.
      Her adult height is about as tall as <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>'s shoulder.
      Many people <i>still</i> think Nynaeve is too young to be the Wisdom;
      however, mentioning this to her is a good way to get whacked by the
      stick she carries.
  <li><a class="name" name="Bili">Bili Congar</a>,
      p. 34 [7]&mdash;A man from
      Emond's Field.  According to <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, he is
      always doing stupid things and always getting hurt.  She has very
      little, if any, respect for him.  He is of an age with
      <a href="#Luhhan">Haral Luhhan</a>, but he <i>looks</i> as though he is
      about ten years older due to his hollow cheeks and sunken eyes.
      Egwene encountered him with the Wisdom after he sliced open his leg due
      to being drunk while trying to shear sheep.
      It is later revealed that he does not believe in the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>, Darkfriends, Aes Sedai, or any of the
      other stories.  He once <i>named</i> the Dark One, but when ill fortune
      struck his crops for months afterwards, he scowled at anyone (such as
      <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>) who attempted to get him to do so again.
  <li><a class="name" name="Elisa">Elisa al'Vere</a>,

      al'Vere of Emond's Field.  She is eighteen.  She wears her hair
      to her waist, tied with a blue kerchief&mdash;the Women's Circle has not
      yet granted her the privilege of wearing it braided.
      She is one year older than <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.
      She is very fond of quotations; Egwene finds in annoying when they get
      stuck in her head.

      she still has not been granted the privilege of wearing her hair in a
      braid, the symbol of womanhood in Emond's Field.  She enjoys flirting,
      and does not seem to be bothered by the fact that many girls as many as

      and Emond's Field.  <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> thinks his ears look
      funny, but many of the other girls in the village think Wil is quite
      pretty.  As a teen, he always had girls staring at him and whispering
      behind his back.  He courted every girl, and managed to convince all of
      them that he was just being polite to the others.
  <li><a class="name" name="Paet">Paet al'Caar</a>,

      he was among those that supported <a href="#Hari">Hari Coplin</a> in his
      accusations that <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> brought the Trollocs to
      Emond's Field on Winternight.  His son, <a href="#Wil">Wil</a>, had his leg
      broken in that attack and was Healed by <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, so

      streaks in it.  His cheeks have been roughened by the sun.  He is a
      solid man.  Keeping his word is important to him.  When Tam was young,
      he left the Two Rivers to see the outside world, something which is
      extremely rare in the Two Rivers.  While there he acquired a sword, and
      married <a href="#Kari">Kari</a>, a woman from Caemlyn.  Since Kari's
      death fifteen years ago, Tam has raised Rand himself.  Since Tam has
      been alone and without a wife for so long, many women in Emond's Field
      have been trying to find a match for him recently.  They've also started
      to think about who would be good for his son as well.  Tam is very
