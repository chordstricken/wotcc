  <li><a class="name" name="Covril">Elder Covril</a>,
      p. 9&mdash;Ogier Elder from
      Stedding Shangtai, daughter of Ella daughter of
      Soong.  She is a fine Speaker.  She came to
      Caemlyn searching for her son <a href="#Loial">Loial</a>, and went with
      Haman and Erith to the Two
      Rivers to find him.  She finally caught up with him, with Haman and
      Erith in tow, and now Loial is married.  She originally spoke out
      against him speaking at the Stump, claiming he was far too young and
      inexperienced.  She later changed her mind, becoming his most vocal
      advocate and eventually convincing the other Elders to allow Loial to
      address the Stump.

  <li><a class="name" name="Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>,
      p. 9&mdash;According
      to the <i>Karaethon Cycle</i>, the Prophecies of the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, the man who is the Rebirth of
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the man known as the Dragon
      during the War of the Shadow.  Over the years, many men have claimed to
      be the Dragon Reborn, even men who could not channel.  The true Dragon
      has been Reborn in a young man named <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, a
      shepherd from Emond's Field.

  <li><a class="name" name="Loial">Loial</a>,
      p. 9&mdash;Son of
      <a href="#Arent">Arent</a> son of <a href="#Halan">Halan</a>, an Ogier
      from Stedding Shangtai.  He left the <i>stedding</i> at around age 90 to
      see the world; by Ogier standards, he is not yet old enough to leave the
      <i>stedding</i> without permission from the Council of Elders.  He is
      fond of books and history, and is an excellent Treesinger.  He is
      writing a book about his travels with the three <i>ta'veren</i> he
      meets, <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>,
      and <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>.
      Loial was constantly afraid that his mother would find him and try to
      marry him off and settle him down; however,
      he does like his mother's choice of wives for him,
      Erith.  He, like most of the Ogier,
      is sad that most humans do not remember the Ogier, and is horrified that
      some even think he is a Trolloc on first seeing him.
      Loial's mother did indeed catch up with him; he and Erith are now
      married.  He is currently in Stedding Shangtai speaking to the Stump.
      Loial is taking notes for a book, which will eventually be called
      <i>The Dragon Reborn</i> and will catalog
      everything he has been through with the three <i>ta'veren</i> as well as
      any details he has been able to pry out of them.

<h3>Prologue:  Distinctions</h3>
<img src="../chapters/snakewheel.gif" width="96" height="97" alt="Wheel of Time icon">
  <li><a class="name" name="Mandarb">Mandarb</a>,
      p. 15&mdash;<a href="#Lan">Lan</a>'s
      black stallion.  His name means &ldquo;Blade&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue.  He is an extraordinary animal.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Faile">t'Aybara, Faile ni Bashere</a>;
      <a href="#Lan">Mandragoran, Lan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</a>,
      p. 123&mdash;The
      uncrowned king of Malkier, and formerly Warder to
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>.  He is quite tall, and does not get
      very emotional&mdash;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that
      he has been building for years.  His country, Malkier, was overrun by
      Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great
      Blight.  Lan, among the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a
      one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He
      fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He
      was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at
      least changed its style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>,
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a>, <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, and
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he
      found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he
      was the last to notice it:  affection for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it,
      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them
      down without him even knowing they were there.  The two of them are now
      married.  According to the terms of their vows as taken before the Sea
      Folk, one of them must obey in public while the other obeys in private;
      for obvious reasons, Nynaeve is the one who commands in public.
      Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred
      to <a href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</a> until Nynaeve is ready to have his
      bond transferred to her.  Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but
      she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods,
      coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were
      in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in
      southern climates).  Upon learning of where Lan was,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder
      for Nynaeve.  He traveled with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai
      she accompanied until he started to feel longing for his homeland.
      Nynaeve understood that he needed to finish his fight in the Blight,
      but she vowed to increase his chance of survival by dropping him off at
      World's End in Saldaea and alerting every surviving Malkieri she could
      find that Lan was marching for Tarwin's Gap. According to the Wise Ones,
      <i><a href="#Aan">Aan'allein</a></i> (as the Aiel call him) will die the
      day he learns that Nynaeve is dead.  He is one of the best, if not
      <i>the</i> best, warriors, swordsmen, and Warders in the world.  Lan
      was determined to avoid all signs of civilization in the Borderlands,
      intending to ride to Tarwin's Gap himself.  Nynaeve had other plans,
      however; she visited dozens of locations throughout the Borderlands and
      alerted any Malkieri she could find of Lan's mission.  He still intends
      to turn as many of them away as he can, but he may have little choice in
      the matter.

      <i><a href="#Aan">Aan'allein</a></i>;
      <a href="#Myrelle">Berengari, Myrelle</a>;
      <a href="#Moiraine">Damodred, Moiraine</a>;
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Mandragoran, Nynaeve ti al'Meara</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a>,
      p. 15&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  Born of a noble House in Cairhien, she is
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>'s youngest half-sister, and
      <a href="#Laman">King Laman</a>'s niece.  She is considered short among
      her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people.  When it was
      discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to
      Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai.  Just before being raised to the
      shawl, she and her friend <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> witnessed
      Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>.  Moiraine and Siuan
      walked away from each other and did not speak to each other again (at
      least in public), but both held secret communication with each other and
      dedicated their lives to finding and guiding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Moiraine found the young man she
      sought on Winternight in Emond's Field, a young man named
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, along with two more <i>ta'veren</i>,
      <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a> and <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>,
      and two women with the spark of the Power inborn,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a> and 
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a>.
      When Moiraine was shortly raised to the shawl, she met
      <a href="#Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</a>, the uncrowned King of Malkier,
      who was fighting alone against the Shadow in the Borderlands;
      she eventually asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted.
      She was very strong in the Power, stronger than almost all living Aes
      Sedai before Egwene and Nynaeve came to the Tower.
      In the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken
      Be'lal with balefire, just before he would have
      killed Rand.  Later, after having an inkling of the future events from
      the testing <i>ter'angreal</i> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to
      push the Forsaken <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> through the twisted
      doorway <i>ter'angreal</i> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both
      her and Lanfear there.
      Moiraine is the subject of the only viewing <a href="#Min">Min</a> has
      ever had that has not come true.  Min assumes it <i>cannot</i> come
      true, as Moiraine is dead, though she has not said yet what the viewing
      said she needed to do&mdash;only that Rand would almost certainly fail
      without her.
      According to a letter Moiraine wrote to <a href="#Thom">Thom Merrilin</a>
      the day before her death, however, she lives on in the land of the Finn,
      but her bond with Lan has been severed.
      The same letter convinced <a href="#Mat">Mat</a> to help Thom rescue
      her, though her vision in the <i>ter'angreal</i> apparently indicated
      disaster would result unless Mat <i>asked</i> to see the letter before
      Thom showed it to him.
      Other Aes Sedai consider Moiraine a legend, not only for
      discovering the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> but for killing or
      trapping two of the Forsaken as well.  Despite her efforts, and for the
      most part, success, <a href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</a> still thinks she
      &ldquo;bungled&rdquo; things with Rand.  Moiraine's current state of
      health is unknown.

      <a href="#Siuan">Sanche, Siuan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Nynaeve">el'Nynaeve ti al'Meara Mandragoran</a>,
      p. 15&mdash;Young woman from Emond's Field, now an Aes Sedai
      of the Yellow Ajah.  She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest
      such ever chosen in Emond's Field.  She left when four of her villagers
      were taken away from the Two Rivers by <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>
      and <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>.  While the group traveled away from her home
      and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries:  she could
      channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing
      what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran,
      Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier;
      and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the
      group do, in the years to come.  She is very strong in the One Power;
      only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match
      her as well as a few young women still being trained.  When she arrived
      in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice,
      despite not being able to even <em>sense</em> the True Source unless
      angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her
      ability without teaching.  She was sent on a false mission by
      Liandrin on which she was almost leashed by the
      Seanchan as <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> was.  After she returned to the
      Tower, <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> sent her on a mission to hunt
      down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in
      Tanchico, she encountered <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a> and managed
      to better her in a duel of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two
      encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her,
      leashing her with an <i>a'dam</i> in <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>.  Nynaeve
      took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and
      <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a> while they were fighting each other, and at
      the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin
      to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could
      draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain
      control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve then kept
      Moghedien under control with a modified <i>a'dam</i> in Salidar until
      Halima helped her escape.
      Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she
      thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and
      wants no part of it.  She is determined to Heal anything short of death,
      and has already managed to Heal gentling.  Nynaeve felt bad when
      Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now
      Lan was free from their bond.  She was not told that Lan's bond had been
      passed to <a href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</a> at the moment of Moiraine's
      death.  She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan's bond to
      pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together.  As Lan's wife,
      she will become the Queen of Malkier when Lan raises the Golden
      Crane and frees Malkier from the Blight.  She now wears the
      <i>ki'sain</i>, an ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives,
      consisting of a dot on the forehead between the eyes&mdash;Lan did not
      tell her of this tradition, but when she found out, she immediately took
      it up.  It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one
      second when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>.  Because she was the only person Rand felt he
      could trust to link with him and the Choedan Kal, he asked Nynaeve to
      assist him when he cleansed <i>saidin</i>.  She now carries the
      <i>ter'angreal</i> she found in Ebou Dar nearly all the time,
      making her collection of jewelry rival that of
      <a href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</a>.  She is even rumored to leave much of this
      jewelry on even when sleeping.  Nynaeve knew she could not prevent Lan
      from returning to the Blight to fight his one-man war, so she deposited
      him as far from Tarwin's Gap as possible while still remaining in the
      Borderlands, then alerted every surviving Malkieri she could find to
      Lan's mission.

      <a href="#Lan">Mandragoran, Lan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Bulen">Bulen</a>,
      p. 16&mdash;Black-haired, tanned Kandori man.  He has thick fingers.
      <a href="#Lan">Lan</a> knew him twenty years ago as a gangly young messenger.
      His father was Malkieri; both parents fell to bandits years ago.  He
      was the first Borderlander to find Lan.  He is good with a sword.
  <li><a class="name" name="Perrin">Perrin t'Bashere Aybara</a>,
      p. 18&mdash;A young man from Emond's Field.  He is <i>ta'veren</i>.  When
      he and <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> got separated from the rest of the
      group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named
      <a href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</a>.  Elyas, a former Warder who found he
      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in
      himself.  Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves' eyes, and
      he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>, the World of Dreams) with them.  Perrin is a
      childhood friend of fellow <i>ta'veren</i>
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> and <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      <a href="#Zarine">Zarine Bashere</a>, a Hunter for the Horn who
      took the name of <a href="#Faile">Faile</a> (which means
      &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a
      Hunter for the Horn.  The two are now married.  Perrin is a very large
      man&mdash;he was always a big person, which caused him to be very
      cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other
      children if his temper got out of hand.  His size helped considerably
      when helping <a href="#Luhhan">Master Luhhan</a> on his forge, but
      that combined with his careful nature sometimes gave others the
      impression that he is slow and stupid.  He returned to the Two Rivers
      for a time to repel the series of Trolloc attacks;
      he and his wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the
      first noblility of the Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.  When he
      returned, he began to draw the eye of
      <a href="#Berelain">Berelain sur Paendrag Paeron</a>,
      the First of Mayene&mdash;Perrin wants nothing more
      than to be as far from her as possible, but Berelain will not take no
      for an answer, much to Faile's dismay and intense jealousy.  Perrin was
      instrumental in freeing Rand from his entrapment at Dumai's Wells; the
      two had a fight afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to
      leave, although they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as
      it was), and Perrin went to Ghealdan to see if he could tame
      <a href="#Masema">Masema</a>.  On the way, his wife was captured by
      Shaido, and he spent weeks single-mindedly trying to track her down.
      He eventually formed an alliance with
      Tylee Khirgan, a Seanchan Banner-General,
      to help him defeat the Shaido and free his wife.
      Despite his strong desires to avoid both combat and lordship,
      Perrin has become a very good general and leader.
      He is currently mired in Ghealdan, and is having some issues keeping the
      man in him separate from the wolf.

      before he left home.  He is a very large man, which works well for work
      at the forge.  His wife, Alsbet, is almost as
      large as he is, and nearly as strong.  He approves of the new arrivals
      in Emond's Field, and has even ventured into business partnerships with
      some of the newcomers.

  <li><a class="name" name="Hopper">Hopper</a>,
      p. 19&mdash;One of the wolves.
      Hopper died in a Whitecloak attack in real life,
      but he lives on in the World of Dreams, <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>.
      He is usually the first (and often only) wolf that finds
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> there.
      Perrin thinks he would laugh as hard as a wolf could laugh at the title
      &ldquo;Wolf King.&rdquo;
      While Faile was missing, Perrin entered the World of Dreams&mdash;what
      he calls the Wolf Dream&mdash;and tried to kill Hopper.  Hopper forgave
      him, of course, and is now trying to teach Perrin how to control himself
      in the Dream.
  <li><a class="name" name="Berelain">Berelain sur Paendrag Paeron</a>,
      p. 19&mdash;The First of Mayene, Blessed of the Light, Defender of the
      Waves, High Seat of House Paeron; the Mayener equivalent of a king or
      queen.  <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> put her in charge of Cairhien along
      with <a href="#Rhuarc">Rhuarc</a> until she left with
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> and <a href="#Faile">Faile</a> to find
      <a href="#Masema">Masema</a>.  She is fond of wearing the latest fashion
      in dresses, and those are usually quite revealing.  She has her eyes on
      many men, but <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> foremost&mdash;she is
      <a href="#Min">Min</a>'s hawk in her viewings of Perrin.  She has black
      hair.  She is a very capable ruler, willing to do almost anything to
      preserve the welfare and independence of her people.  She is tall,
      pretty, young, and has black hair.  Since Faile's captivity, she has
      backed off of Perrin, though rumors have been circulating that the she
      and Perrin slept together.  They did not, of course; Perrin was simply
      taken into her tent until he recovered from illness.  She and Faile are
      working things out between themselves, attempting to defuse the rumors.
      Berelain is willing to do almost <i>anything</i> to ensure that Mayene
      is preserved and not merely annexed by another larger country.  She is
      one of the most skillful political maneuverers that Faile has
      <i>ever</i> met.

  <li><a class="name" name="Faile">Faile ni Bashere t'Aybara</a>,
      p. 19&mdash;Young woman from Saldaea with long dark hair and dark eyes.
      She is the daughter of <a href="#Bashere">Davram</a> and
      <a href="#Deira">Deira</a> Bashere, their oldest surviving offspring.
      Her two older brothers were killed, and when Davram sent her younger
      brother off to fight while keeping her at home, she ran away and swore
      the oath of a Hunter of the Horn in Illian.  When she became a Hunter,
      she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering adopting the
      name &ldquo;Mandarb&rdquo;&mdash;she chose Faile when she found that
      <a href="#Mandarb">Mandarb</a> was the name of <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>'s
      horse.  She fell in love with <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a> while
      on her search for the Horn, who told her that the Horn had been found.
      She was shocked, but even more so to find out that
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> was the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> and
      that both he and Perrin are <i>ta'veren</i>.  Faile stayed near Perrin,
      and finally accompanied him to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off
      the Trolloc attacks; the two were married shortly afterwards.  They were
      then proclaimed Lord and Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea,
      but Faile insisted they have a modest estate, and even servants, which
      she trained herself.  Her name means &ldquo;falcon&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue; she is the falcon in <a href="#Min">Min</a>'s viewings of
      Perrin.  She is very protective of her blacksmith, and does whatever she
      can to make sure he not so much as <i>looks</i> at another woman, even
      though he has no intention of doing so.  She is a very jealous wife,
      especially toward people like <a href="#Berelain">Berelain</a> who eye
      her husband all the time.  She even cornered <a href="#Min">Min</a> when
      they first came to Caemlyn and Perrin greeted her warmly, to make sure
      Min had no intentions toward him.  She left with Perrin for Ghealdan to
      find <a href="#Masema">Masema</a>, and while he was away her party was
      ambushed by the Shaido Aiel and she was taken <i>gai'shain</i> by them.
      She and the servants captured with her attempted to escape, but were
      betrayed by Galina Casban.  She was
      now a personal servant of <a href="#Sevanna">Sevanna</a>, and she
      seemed to be one of Sevanna's favorites&mdash;for both service and
      punishment.  She is a natural leader, even earning the respect
      and obedience of <a href="#Alliandre">Alliandre</a>, the Queen of
      Ghealdan, and <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>, the former Queen of
      Andor (though she does not know Morgase's true identity).
      Alliandre, Morgase, and Faile were rescued by the <i>Mera'din</i>,
      the Brotherless, Aiel men traveling with the Shaido when the left the
      Three-Fold Land.
      Their rescue coincided with Perrin's attack on the Shaido encampment,
      resulting in the deaths of many of the Aielmen.
      Now that she has been rescued, Faile has taken it upon herself to do
      the things her husband is unable or unwilling to do&mdash;first among
      them, killing <a href="#Masema">Masema</a>, the <a href="#Prophet">Prophet</a>.
      She has since been trying to patch things up with Berelain, attempting
      to deal with the rumors about inappropriate relations between her and
      Perrin.

      dressed in robes, telling him to kill Perrin Aybara.
      He convinced Aram that Perrin's yellow eyes were a result of him being
      Shadowspawn, which convinced Aram to attempt to kill Perrin.
      In his last moments before Faile killed him, the Prophet dimly remembers
      his true name, Masema, and the life he had lead before becoming the
      Prophet of the Dragon Reborn.

  <li><a class="name" name="Graendal">Graendal</a>,
      p. 24&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken, a fleshy woman with curled red-gold hair.
      Before the War of the Shadow, she became the leading authority on
      diseases of the brain, and spent much of her life dealing with the
      insane, schizophrenic, and others well beyond the touch of Healing.  She
      was the best at subtle manipulations of the human mind that ever lived.
      After the Bore was drilled, she went through a change after she realized
      the world could never live up to her standards.  So she began dressing
      in the very way she once mocked, with low cut dresses that clung to her
      and left little to the imagination.  After being released from the Bore,
      Graendal took up residence in Arad Doman, capturing several members of
      the Royal Family to use as servants.  All of her servants are not only
      physically well shaped and good-looking, but also had power in their
      society before she captured them.  She includes in her collection the
      sister of the Domani king, two rulers from Shara, and other important
      figures.  With Sammael dead,
      <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a> is the only person who knows how to find her.
      Graendal has been allowed limited access to the True Power through
      Moridin in recent days; she cannot take as much as she wants, but it is
      enough to, for example, take possession of a dove's mind and see through
      its eyes.  Unbeknownst to <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, Graendal <i>survived</i> his
      attack on <a href="#Natrin">Natrin</a>'s Barrow.  Since he believes her dead, she
      feels she can plot against him&mdash;or someone else important to
      him&mdash;without anyone suspecting that she is involved.

  <li><a class="name" name="Arangar">Aran'gar</a>,
      p. 24&mdash;Name given to
      the reincarnation of Balthamel.  Aran'gar was
      the right-hand dagger in a form of dueling popular right after the
      creation of the Bore.  The sport fell from common practice, since almost
      invariably both duelists died from the slow poison on the daggers.  The
      other Forsaken consider Balthamel's new body a fine joke; the soul of
      Balthamel now occupies the body of a beautiful young woman.  She still
      channels <i>saidin</i>, and now serves as <a href="#Delana">Delana</a>'s
      maid.  Delana does not know that she is one of the Chosen reincarned,
      just that she stands far above her among the Darkfriends.  Aran'gar, as
      Balthamel, specialized in primitive cultures.
      Aran'gar's cover was blown when she tried to touch the ward against
      eavesdropping around the meeting of the Hall of the Tower in exile,
      at which time <a href="#Romanda">Romanda Cassin</a> deduced that she and
      Delana were Darkfriends.  She has since been hiding, along with
      Delana, at <a href="#Natrin">Natrin</a>'s Barrow with <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a>.
      She was killed by <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> with the giant weave of balefire he
      used to destroy Natrin's Barrow.  Her death meant the Compulsion that
      Graendal asked her and Delana to implant on
      <a href="#Ramshalan">Lord Ramshalan</a>'s mind vanished&mdash;Rand
      thought Graendal herself had implanted the Compulsion, so Graendal
      shielded Aran'gar so she could not escape.  Aran'gar is now <i>very</i>
      dead, as is Delana.

  <li><a class="name" name="Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>,
      p. 25&mdash;Young
      woman from Emond's Field and daughter of the innkeeper there,
      now raised to the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  She
      has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be
      one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years.  She is also
      the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the
      Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent.
      Before her time with the Wise Ones, she was sold by
      Liandrin to <a href="#Suroth">Suroth</a> to be made <i>damane</i>.
      She was held captive under the name Tuli
      under care of the <i>sul'dam</i> Renna Emain.
      When Egwene escaped, she left Renna with her <i>a'dam</i> around
      Renna's neck; the fact that Renna and another <i>sul'dam</i>,
      <a href="#Seta">Seta</a>, who was similarly captured when Egwene escaped,
      were bound by the <i>a'dam</i> threatens to destroy the foundation of
      Seanchan society, especially their enslavement of women who can
      channel.  Egwene is good friends with
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>, the
      <a href="#DH">Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>, and is
      also a childhood friend of <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  In fact, Rand and Egwene were all
      but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost
      sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get
      married, and do not want to.  Egwene is the love object of both of
      Elayne's brothers, <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> and
      <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>&mdash;she is flattered by Galad's attentions,
      but she does not return them. She does find Gawyn to her liking, and had
      a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur, though
      she and Gawyn have some things to work out between the two of them.
      Egwene was most likely chosen Amyrlin because she was in the Aiel Waste
      when the rebellion occurred, and because the Aes Sedai thought she could
      be manipulated by them without too much trouble; if this was their
      intent, they made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the
      strongest Amyrlins in history.
      Egwene enlisted Gareth Bryne
      as the commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> from power.  The invasion turned out to be
      unnecessary&mdash;Elaida was captured, and the Hall chose her to replace
      her before the invasion began.
      Egwene has opened the novice books to all
      interested women for the first time in history&mdash;in the past, they
      were only open to girls of a certain age, for fear that older women
      would not be able to handle the discipline.  This policy has increased
      the Tower's population to levels unseen since
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>'s time.
      Egwene has also discovered many lost Talents
      of the Age of Legends, such as Dreaming, Traveling, and the making of
      <i>cuendillar</i>.  She was guided to Dreaming by the Wise Ones, with
      whom she studied in the Aiel Waste, and was guided to the making of
      <i>cuendillar</i> by <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a> while she was
      captured, but Traveling was her discovery alone&mdash;she worked it out
      herself based on her familiarity with Tel'aran'rhiod.  She has recovered
      some other abilities through Moghedien as well.
      Prior to the reunification of the Tower,
      Egwene was captured by sisters loyal to Elaida after executing her plan
      to block the harbor by turning the harbor chain to <i>cuendillar</i>.
      She was held prisoner in the Tower, and re-enlisted as a Novice
      again.  She accepted all punishments Elaida and others imposed upon her
      for insisting that she was still the Amyrlin Seat and still Aes Sedai.
      Her strong will and persistence earned her the respect of nearly
      all the novices, several of the Accepted, and more than a few Aes Sedai
      as well.
      Egwene's plans to subvert Elaida from the inside by making suggestions
      and hinting that various things Elaida has done are indefinsible helped
      convince even more sisters, including <a href="#Silviana">Silviana</a>, to
      support her.
      Egwene tried very hard to convince the Hall&mdash;both the
      Hall in Tar Valon and the Hall in Exile&mdash;that they must be prepared
      for the Seanchan attack she knew was imminent.  When it came anyway,
      she fought harder than perhaps anyone believed possible, doing almost as
      much damage to the Seanchan as they did to the Tower's inhabitants.
      Egwene was rescued from the Tower shortly after the raid by
      Gawyn, Bryne, and <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>&mdash;she was quite angry at Siuan
      and Gawyn for disobeying her orders to leave her be.  Gawyn is still
      trying to crawl back into her good graces.  She would probably refuse to
      acknowledge it, but she is almost as stubborn as
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.

      p. 25&mdash;Name given to
      the reincarnation of <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a>.
      His new body is tall, black-haired, handsome, and broad-shouldered,
      but with a prominent chin that ruins the look
      (in <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a>'s eyes, at least).  His name means
      &ldquo;Death&rdquo; in the Old Tongue; no one deserves the name more.
      He is fond of using the True Power, the power drawn directly from
      the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>; the <i>saa</i> have already appeared
      in his eyes, yet he still controls his use of the True Power (most
      thought it impossible to avoid drawing too much of it once the
      <i>saa</i> appeared).  Moridin is careful not to attempt to force the
      Pattern to behave how he wants it to&mdash;he knows that with someone as
      strongly <i>ta'veren</i> as <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, that is all but
      impossible, not to mention foolish.  Instead, he attempts to keep
      everything in chaos (as per the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s
      command, &ldquo;Let the Lord of Chaos Rule&rdquo;), hoping that subtle
      manipulations will further his goals.  He has been declared
      <a href="#Naeblis">Nae'blis</a>, the one to be second only to the
      Great Lord of the Dark after the Last Battle, and given control of the
      <i>cour'souvra</i> controlling the minds of
      Cyndane and <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a>.
      He has also been granted the exclusive privilege of using the True
      Power&mdash;the other Forsaken are no longer able to touch it even
      should they want to.
      Moridin helped Rand, in a way, during his fight with
      Sammael in Shadar Logoth.
      Their two streams of balefire crossed, causing both of their heads to
      ring, and ever since then there has been a link between Moridin and
      Rand that Moridin does not completely understand and Rand seems unaware
      exists.  Its influence is clear, however&mdash;now that Rand's hand is
      missing, Moridin's left hand does not work as well as it should.
      Moridin has recently granted <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a> some limited access to
      the True Power, though he has her on a short leash.  He is a grand
      master at the game of Sha'rah, a chess-like game from the Age of
      Legends; Moridin believes the game to be a distant memory of the battle
      with the Dark One during this Age in the previous turnings of the
      Wheel.  His connection with Rand recently allowed Rand to enter his
      dreams; the same connection seems to have given Rand access to the
      True Power.  He turned to the Shadow for reasons of logic:  following
      the Light meant the struggle continued forever, with no path to
      victory.  Following the Shadow meant ruling for a short time before
      everything was destroyed.

      war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free the Dark One
      completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by
      some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of
      important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark
      One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the
      most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War of the Shadow
      did not end until <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to
      Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping
      the Forsaken with him.  At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at
      those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <i>saidin</i>
      itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to
      madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are
      weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is
      once again able to exert influence on the world.  These seals were
      scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the
      World.  In order of when they were discovered, they were found:  1) At
      the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of
      <a href="#Domon">Bayle Domon</a>, later pilfered by
      High Lord Turak of the Seanchan (broken at the
      battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection
      (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of
      Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broken
      enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and 7) Found by
      <a href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</a> on a small farm in Saldaea (still
      intact).  Despite being made of <i>cuendillar</i>, the three that remain
      unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a fall from a table.
      According to the Forsaken, the Dark One is capable of destroying
      anything, just as the Creator is capable of creating
      anything&mdash;similarly, anything that the One Power can do,
      the True Power can undo.
      The Dark One is also referred to by other euphemisms, including
      Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Father of Lies, Grassburner,
      Leafblighter, Heartfang, Heartsbane, Soulsbane, Lord of the Twilight,
      Father of Storms, Shepherd of the Night, Soulblinder, Lighteater,
      and (among Darkfriends) the Great Lord of the Dark.
  <li><a class="name" name="Delana">Delana Mosalaine</a>,
      p. 26&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Black Ajah, openly a Sitter for the Gray Ajah in the
      &ldquo;Little Tower.&rdquo;  She used to be the only Sitter that
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> thought she could count on for her support.
      She is round, and has a deep voice for a woman and pale silver-colored
      hair.  She is from Shienar, and has no Warder.  Delana started to cause
      trouble in the Hall, especially with her demand to make a
      formal declaration that <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> is Black Ajah.  She
      was willing to discuss any subject in the Hall, whereas most Sitters
      would not touch topics such as the Black Ajah with a ten-foot pole.  Her
      pale blue eyes give nothing away.  Like many of her fellow members of
      the Hall, she is young to be a Sitter.  Her maid is named
      Halima, and she often lent her to Egwene; Halima
      was the only person who seemed to be able to make Egwene's headaches go
      away.  Halima, of course, was <em>causing</em> Egwene's headaches, but
      she was not aware of that.  Delana went pale and excused herself from
      the Hall when <a href="#Narishma">Narishma</a> reported that a woman was
      able to channel <i>saidin</i> and then detected a someone attempting to
      break through the ward against eavesdropping with <i>saidin</i>.
      <a href="#Romanda">Romanda</a> subsequently put two and two together,
      and demanded Delana be arrested.  She and Halima had already left the
      camp.  Delana was also on <a href="#Verin">Verin</a>'s list of Black sisters.
      Since leaving the rebels, Delana has been in hiding at
      <a href="#Natrin">Natrin</a>'s Barrow with <a href="#Arangar">Aran'gar</a> and
      <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a>; according to Graendal, she and Aran'gar are in a
      relationship of sorts.  She was killed by Rand's massive balefire weave
      that destroyed the Barrow and its inhabitants.
  <li><a class="name" name="Ramshalan">Lord Piqot Ramshalan</a>,
      p. 27&mdash;Member of the Domani merchants' council.
      He is a buffoon; he remarked to other Domani nobles that he could
      manipulate the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> however he wished.
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> used him as bait for <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a>; she ordered
      <a href="#Arangar">Aran'gar</a> and <a href="#Delana">Delana</a> to lay
      Compulsion weaves on him, and then sent him back to Rand.  Ramshalan
      thinks he will be chosen King of Arad Doman by gaining Rand's
      confidence&mdash;and he is enough of a buffoon to actually believe he is
      succeeding.
  <li><a class="name" name="Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>,
      p. 27&mdash;A young man from
      Emond's Field in the Two Rivers, now proclaimed to be the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  He is very tall, with curly
      red-blond hair and bright blue-gray eyes that shine like gemstones.
      He was raised by <a href="#Tam">Tam al'Thor</a> and his
      wife Kari (until her death around the time Rand was
      five) in Emond's Field.  His real parents, however, were
      Janduin, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who
      brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish
      <a href="#Laman">Laman</a>'s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named
      Shaiel, who was actually
      <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine Damodred</a>, the runaway
      <a href="#DH">Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>.
      Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in
      accordance with prophecy: &ldquo;born of a Maiden, of the ancient
      blood but raised by the Old.&rdquo;  Rand has a heron branded into
      each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while
      fighting <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a>.  He also has two
      dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him
      as the <i><a href="#Caracarn">Car'a'carn</a></i>, the Chief of Chiefs of
      the Aiel.  He has recently taken to wearing a new sword:  curved, with
      a black scabbard, painted with two twisting dragons much like those on
      his forearms.  It was found under a submerged statue.
      He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also
      He Who Comes With the Dawn,
      the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and
      the <a href="#Coramoor">Coramoor</a>, the one prophesied to bring the
      Sea Folk out of the Sea.  He can channel strongly, more so than any
      person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul,
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who was obviously of equal
      strength), and is also <i>ta'veren</i>, the most strongly so since Lews
      Therin as well.  Lews Therin's voice seemed to have found a new place
      inside of Rand's head for some time;
      he talked to him in a mad voice when Rand least expected it,
      sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling,
      sometimes even trying to wrest control of <i>saidin</i> from him.
      <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> revealed that hearing this voice was a symptom of
      the madness associated with touching tainted <i>saidin</i> for as long
      as Rand did.  Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other
      <i>ta'veren</i> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days
      (hours, even) of him named <a href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, who both grew up in Emond's Field
      as well.  Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has):
      <a href="#Min">Min Farshaw</a>, <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>,
      and <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a>.  Rand has had success in fighting
      many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped.
      He killed <a href="#Aginor">Aginor</a> at the Eye of the World after the
      Green Man killed
      Balthamel; he allowed
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> to kill
      Be'lal in the Stone of Tear, and killed
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> in the Stone shortly afterward; in the
      wagons near the Spine of the World, <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a>
      confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine;
      he killed <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a> in <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i> when he
      came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn;
      <a href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</a>, his teacher, was killed shortly after
      Rahvin met his fate; Sammael met his fate while
      fighting Rand in Shadar Logoth at the hands of Mashadar;
      Osan'gar, the reincarnation of
      <a href="#Aginor">Aginor</a>, died at Shador Logoth when Rand was
      cleansing <i>saidin</i>;
      <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> was captured during her attempt
      to capture Rand and bind him with a male <i>a'dam</i>;
      and <a href="#Arangar">Aran'gar</a> died when he attacked
      <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a>'s hold at <a href="#Natrin">Natrin</a>'s Barrow.
      During his duel with Sammael, Rand encountered
      a mysterious wanderer, who turned out to be <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a>, who
      helped him.  During the fighting, their streams of balefire collided,
      causing Rand's head to spin and both of them to lose coherency for a
      while.  Ever since that time, Rand has had trouble seizing
      <i>saidin</i>; it is not known if this is because of Moridin's
      use of the True Power or something else.
      During his fight with Semirhage,
      Rand had his hand burned away by her weave of Fire;
      Moridin has since been seen favoring his left hand,
      as if Rand's injury is somehow affecting him.
      Since the hand cannot be repaired,
      Rand has moved on without it&mdash;others have compared it to the
      reaction one might have after losing a glove.
      Rand was captured for a brief period by <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a>,
      after <a href="#Shaidar">Shaidar Haran</a> freed her from her captivity
      at Aes Sedai hands.  She attempted to force him to choke Min to death,
      but Rand's connection to Moridin evidently allowed him to access the
      True Power, and he used that connection to weave balefire and destroy
      Semirhage.  Thereafter, Rand steeled himself to do what he must,
      without emotional influence, without distraction from feelings, until
      finally the emotions grew too much to handle&mdash;he finally Traveled
      to Dragonmount, standing upon his own grave in fulfillment of Prophecy,
      and contemplated his life, and all of his past lives, finally
      determining that life and creation were not worth it unless you could
      laugh and cry.  He destroyed the male Choedan Kal, and
      seems to have cured his madness (or at least blocked it somehow) in
      the process.  Rand's prophecies fulfilled grow:  he has already
      been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood
      but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn
      <i>Callandor</i>, and began conquering &ldquo;under the forgotten
      symbol,&rdquo; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  He is
      working on having the &ldquo;spotless tower&rdquo; (i.e., the White
      Tower) break and bend knee to him (the Tower has broken, and several Aes
      Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him).
      He slayed &ldquo;his people&rdquo; (the Aiel) with the &ldquo;sword
      of peace&rdquo; and destroyed them &ldquo;with the [Way of the]
      Leaf&rdquo; (referring to his dividing the Aiel with news that they used
      to be a peacful, non-violent people).  He has &ldquo;wounds of
      madness&rdquo; from Fain's dagger (and from the taint), and has
      led the Aiel spears &ldquo;from the city, lost and forsaken&rdquo;
      (Rhuidean).  And of course, he has stood &ldquo;on his own grave&rdquo;
      and wept, referring to his scene at Dragonmount where he went from
      being &ldquo;blind&rdquo; to the reasons for life to
      &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; the reasons of life again.
      Some time ago, he used the
      Choedan Kal, the two great <i>sa'angreal</i> created during the War of
      the Shadow, to cleanse the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s taint from
      <i>saidin</i>.  He has created schools of sorts, more research
      universities, where some of the best inventors of the day have
      congregated near Cairhien, Caemlyn, and Tear to develop new technology.
      Rand has also created the Asha'man, men who came for his
      &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; for male channelers.  With <i>saidin</i> cleansed,
      the Asha'man are now safe from the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s taint.
      The Asha'man themselves are not free from the Dark One's
      <em>influence</em>, however; there are many Darkfriends among the
      Asha'man, including <a href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</a>, the leader of the
      Black Tower.  The Asha'man under Taim have turned on Rand, trying to
      kill him and worse, though Rand does not at this point know that they
      were acting with Taim's knowledge.  Rand is under <i>considerable</i>
      stress at the moment&mdash;he has made it a point to make himself
      harder, believing that emotionlessness is the key to surviving to do
      what he must do.  Rand is the salvation of the entire
      world, and as the prophecy states, he <em>will</em> save the
      world&mdash;and Break it again.  <i>Editor's note:  there has been some
      speculation as to the origin of Rand's new sword.  Some suggest that it
      is Justice, the sword of Artur Hawkwing.  I submit
      that the dragons wrapped around the blade suggest a much earlier origin:
      the sword of Lews Therin Telamon himself.</i>

  <li><a class="name" name="Aginor">Aginor</a>,
      p. 28&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, he was one of the foremost
      biologists of his time, specializing in genetics.  He went over to the
      Shadow because only there could he do all of the experiments he wanted
      to.  He was the one who created the Trollocs, Dragkhar, <i>gholam</i>,
      Darkhounds, and other Shadowspawn.  Some of the other Forsaken think he
      was insane, for only someone insane would create some of the creatures
      he did.  He was the second one to be released from the sealing on the
      Bore, after Balthamel.  He was trapped close to
      the surface of the Bore, so he was not shielded from the passing of time
      very effectively; he emerged as a very old man, so old that his face was
      wrinkled so that one could barely make out his features anymore.  He was
      killed by <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> at the Eye of the World.  Unbeknownst
      to almost everyone (including the Forsaken), Aginor was reincarnated in
      the body of a Borderlander man and given the new name
      Osan'gar.  Osan'gar masqueraded as
      Corlan Dashiva, one of the Asha'man, until he was
      killed at the cleansing of <i>saidin</i> by
      Elza Penfell and her circle.
      One of Aginor's creations was the
      <i>zomara</i>, androgynous not-quite-human servants; they are almost
      useless for any other task.  <a href="#Arangar">Aran'gar</a> describes
      them as one of Aginor's &ldquo;less inspired creations.&rdquo;
  <li><a class="name" name="Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      p. 29&mdash;The
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, Breaker of the World.  He was perhaps the
      greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes Sedai in recorded
      history.  During the War of the Shadow, at the age of 400, he led the
      forces of the Light against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which
      re-sealed the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> back into his prison.
      Unfortunately, during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's
      touch, eventually killing his wife Ilyena, his children,
      and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of his
      blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:
      Kinslayer.  After he had done this,
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> gave him his sanity back long enough
      for him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by
      drawing on <i>saidin</i> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the
      spot where he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near
      the present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of
      one of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for
      Lews Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but
      without Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to
      kill them.  Lews Therin's voice often spoke inside
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>'s head, offering advice or sobbing over lost
      women or ranting about killing men who could channel.  It even tried to
      seize control of <i>saidin</i> sometimes, much to Rand's
      fear&mdash;Rand was certain that Lews Therin could not take control of
      <i>saidin</i> away from him if he seized it first,
      but experience had shown that if Lews Therin seized it first,
      Rand would be at his mercy until he released.
      <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> revealed that Lews Therin's
      voice in Rand's head is not without precedent&mdash;indeed, hearing a
      real voice often indicates a person dangerously close to outright
      insanity.  Rand's time spent atop Dragonmount, when he destroyed the
      remaining Choedan Kal, seems to have liberated Rand's brain from the
      Dark One's touch&mdash;he no longer hears the voice in his head, and has
      effectively reunited Lews Therin's memories with his own inside Rand's
      head.

      handsome; even <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> has trouble blushing when
      she speaks to him, and Aes Sedai often forsook their work to watch
      him practice (shirtless) in the sword yard when he was in training.
      He disappeared from Tar Valon during the violence that
      accompanied <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>'s deposition and joined
      <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>'s band of the Children of the Light.
      Because of his sword skill, Galad was promoted to an official position
      very quickly, and soon controlled his own small band of men.  He says he
      became a Whitecloak because it &ldquo;felt right.&rdquo;  He is
      extremely virtuous, and will do whatever he thinks is right regardless
      of who it hurts, even himself.  In fact, he started a war in Samara to
      help Elayne and Nynaeve escape.  His sign is a winged silver sword,
      point down.  Galad has feelings for <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>,
      and although she is flattered by his attentions, she does not return his
      love.  He was quite popular among his soldiers.  Galad believed
      that Valda killed his mother after sexually abusing her, and killed him
      as punishment for this.  He was incorrect about the killing part, at
      least.  Galad has much skill with the sword,
      and has officially achieved Blademaster status by killing Valda,
      by many accounts one of the greatest swordsmen in the world.
      According to <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>'s visions of
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a>, Galad currently travels with Perrin.

      Captain Commander of the Children of the Light after the death of
      <a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a>.  He killed Niall's assassin shortly
      after the act, but it is not known whether this was set up, or whether
      Valda just happened to be in the right place at the right time.  One of
      his first acts was to dismiss Niall's secretary,
      <a href="#Balwer">Sebban Balwer</a>, for &ldquo;someone who didn't
      twitch.&rdquo;  This was a mistake, as Balwer was Niall's
      <i>true</i> Master of Spies&mdash;he knows more about spying than
      anyone else in the world.  Valda offered assistance to
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>, as Niall had promised, but before doing
      so he required a &ldquo;service&rdquo; of her:  to share his bed.
      Morgase escaped during the Seanchan attack, and Valda believes her to be
      dead.  He has since fallen into disfavor with the Children of the Light,
      most especially with <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>, because of his dealings
      with Morgase; Galad because she is his stepmother, and with the other
      Children because she trained with the &ldquo;witches&rdquo; in Tar
      Valon.  Galad has challenged him to Trial Beneath the Light for his
      crimes against Morgase.  Valda is one of the best swordsmen in the
      world, and expected to finish Galad easily.  As we know, Galad was a
      better swordsman than his brother, who himself killed two Blademasters
      at the same time, so one expects a good duel.

  <li><a class="name" name="Morgase">Morgase Trakand</a>,
      p. 34&mdash;Former
      Queen of Andor and High Seat of House Trakand.  Mother of
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>.  She
      married <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>, a prince of
      Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the Throne of Andor and keep
      peace between the two nations; when <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>
      disappeared, Morgase made the best claim to succeed her, and married her
      widower to gain the support that would be gained by such action.
      Taringail was Elayne's and Gawyn's father; he died when they were young.
      Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including
      <a href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</a>, a former court-bard;
      Gareth Bryne, her First Prince of the Sword and
      Captain of the Guards; and most recently
      <a href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>,
      a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn
      that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne's
      whereabouts.  Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started
      telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her
      relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to
      exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the
      city when she found he was usurping her power.  The Daughter-Heir of
      Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and
      Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive.  She was
      given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and
      still wears it on her left hand.  She was previously advised by
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a> of the Red Ajah, who is
      now the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> in Tar Valon.  When Morgase
      discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was actually
      <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a>) meant to usurp her throne, she left, and
      when she learned that the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> had taken
      over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she
      fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could:
      <a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a> and the Children of the Light.  She
      was not aware that <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> only wanted to give her
      country back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead.  If she
      had made her presence known, she would no doubt have had her country
      back in one piece, but as royalty she believed she must work on her own
      and trust no one.  She went into hiding after the Seanchan attack
      (<a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>
      believes her to be dead) under her mother's first name,
      Maighdin to avoid instant recognition, and later
      became a maidservant to <a href="#Faile">Faile</a>; she told Faile that
      she was a lady's handmaid before coming into her service.  When Faile's
      group was captured, she became a prisoner of the Shaido, and is now
      detained in their encampment.  Her sign is three golden keys.
      Morgase has come to many realizations about her life, and about her
      choice in men:  Taringail saw her as a pawn, Thom as a beauty to be
      hunted and romanced, Gareth Bryne as a queen to be served.  None had
      made her his entire life.  However, a former
      member of the Queen's Guard, <a href="#Tallanvor">Martyn Tallanvor</a>,
      has taken a liking to his former queen, and she finds herself almost
      unconsciously returning his attentions.  Her adopted son
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> believes her dead at the hands of Eamon
      Valda, and plans revenge on him.  Her son Gawyn believes her dead at the
      hands of the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, and is only restrained
      from killing him by <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>'s command.  Her
      daughter Elayne believes her dead as well (though she as yet has no
      plans for vengeance), and her new mistress Faile has no idea of her true
      identity.  Since we know from Rand's visions of <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> that
      Galad and Perrin eventually cross paths, it appears that a family
      reunion is in the works.

      is the daughter of <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> and her late husband,
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>, and sister to
      <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>.  She is also half-sister to
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>, although she would rather not be reminded of
      this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not
      really like him.  She has considerable potential in the One Power, and
      is one of the strongest female channelers in a thousand years or more,
      possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exceptions of
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, Sharina,
      <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a>, and some trainees.  She has
      red-gold curly hair.  During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne
      realized she loved <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, and told him how
      she felt; he felt similarly.  She had no idea at the time what
      <a href="#Min">Min</a> meant about &ldquo;having to share him,&rdquo;
      but now knows about Min's viewing of Rand with the three women's heads,
      indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and Aviendha,
      and they with him.  Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with
      <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a>, Elayne ended up bonding
      <a href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</a> as her Warder (despite being only
      Accepted at the time) in order to save Birgitte's life.  Elayne later
      went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a <i>ter'angreal</i>
      that they used to fix the weather.  She then returned to Andor upon
      hearing news of her mother's disappearance; she has since taken the Lion
      Throne, fighting the Black Ajah, Darkfriends, and other Andoran nobles.
      She recently ended <a href="#Arymilla">Arymilla</a>'s campaign for the
      Throne, which convinced all but one of the necessary nobles to support
      her for the Lion Throne.
      During that campaign, Elayne was captured by the Black Ajah,
      though Birgitte convinced the Windfinders to help rescue her.  She then
      convinced several other houses to support her&mdash;evidently their
      main concern was that she would be a puppet of Rand al'Thor.  In the
      mean time, Elayne has managed to reproduce several <i>ter'angreal</i>,
      something which no one else has been able to do since the Breaking of
      the World, as well as discover a way to share a Warder bond between
      three women; she bonded Rand along with Aviendha, her new sister by Aiel
      tradition, and Min.  Shortly after bonding Rand, she became pregnant
      with Rand's twins.  To protect the children, she is not revealing the
      father of the twins, and has allowed the rumor that
      <a href="#Mellar">Doilin Mellar</a> is their father to persist as an
      added means of protection.
      She is the first ruler of Andor to <i>ever</i> cede land to anyone:
      she agreed with the Sea Folk to cede a few square miles of Andor to them
      in exchange for their help feeding the city during the siege.
      She also sends Andoran troops to the Black Tower (which is on Andoran
      soil) periodically to remind its inhabitants that they are still within
      Andor and subject to its laws.  She is proving to be a capable leader,
      one her people may eventually be quite proud of, though for now times in
      Andor are hard enough that most do not appreciate her yet.

      the list of candidates to three boys in Emond's Field.  While
      persuing them, he encountered the spirit of
      <a href="#Mordeth">Mordeth</a> in Aridhol, now called Shadar Logoth.
      Mordeth attempted to consume Fain's soul, but instead the two souls
      merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone.  Fain
      no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda.
      It is said, &ldquo;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&rdquo; from
      observing that a Myrddraal's look causes fear in the hearts of men.
      Fain's look has that effect on Myrddraal&mdash;Fades feel the same fear
      of Fain as men feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called
      Ordeith, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak
      officer.  He is perhaps the most evil man alive.  He later served as
      advisor to Toram Riatin, one of the Cairhienin
      nobles in rebellion to <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>.  Rand has a bounty of
      100,000 gold crowns on his head&mdash;Fain killed Rand's friends because
      they were his friends, he pillaged his homeland because it was his
      homeland, and Rand intends to see him dead for it.
      Rand still bears the wound that Fain's dagger gave him;
      the evil from Fain's dagger fighting the evil from
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a>'s staff gave Rand the idea he used to
      cleanse <i>saidin</i>.  Fain is now in the Great Blight, killing
      Shadowspawn for the sheer pleasure of it and waiting for Rand to arrive
      so he can kill him.  He can kill a Myrddraal simply by touching it with
      the Mashadar-like mist that exudes from him, and he can
      kill worms with ease.

      trusting, more cruel.  Slowly it became so, until finally the city was,
      if not darker than the Shadow, as dark.  The city finally turned on
      itself, consumed itself, tainting every grain of sand, every rock, every
      sip of water with its hatred.  Mordeth's soul remained in the city, now
      called Shadar Logoth (&ldquo;Where the Shadow Waits&rdquo;) for
      millenia&mdash;he could not leave the city unless he accompanied a
      person to the city walls or had them carry something from the city to
      the outside world.  Strangely enough, both of these things happened at
      the same time, when <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a> carried the
      ruby-handled dagger from the city while <a href="#Fain">Padan Fain</a>
      accompanied Mordeth out of the city at about the same time.  Mordeth
      attempted to consume Fain's soul while the dagger tried to consume
      Mat's.  In Fain's case, the attempt to consume his soul was not
      completely successful&mdash;instead, the two souls merged to create
      something more evil than either Mordeth or Fain alone.  Fain now feels
      incomplete without the tainted dagger that was removed from the city.

      when Rand was a boy.  He has a calm manner.
      He taught Rand about the
      Flame and the Void, a trick he uses to concentrate and to win archery
      competitions; Rand found that it is the way he can gain access to
      <i>saidin</i>.  Tam is not actually Rand's biological father; he found
      Rand as a newborn on the slopes of Dragonmount and took him home with
      him since Rand's mother was dead.  He was at Dragonmount as part of the
      Aiel War, which he left home to participate in when he was young.  He
      became an officer in the Illianer army, and even achieved Blademaster
      status, acquiring a heron-mark sword.  In fact,
      Demetre Marcolin served under him when he was a
      Second Captain in the Companions.  He married a woman from Caemlyn,
      Kari, who he met while stationed there.  When the
      Aiel War started, he fought Aiel all the way to Tar Valon and the Battle
      of the Shining Walls, where he found Rand on the mountain.  Tam and Kari
      raised Rand as their own son.  Tam always won the archery competitions
      (or came in second to Abell Cauthon), and passed
      his archery skills on to Rand.  He also taught <a href="#Aram">Aram</a>

      of Rand's glory as the &ldquo;Lord Dragon Reborn.&rdquo;  Rand
      dispatched <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> to bring Masema back into line.
      He was stark raving mad, and very dangerous. He even claimed that Masema

<h3>Chapter 3:  The Amyrlin's Anger</h3>
<img src="../chapters/astear.gif" width="82" height="86" alt="Flame of Tar Valon icon">
  <li><a class="name" name="Amyrlin">The Amyrlin Seat</a>,
      p. 73&mdash;The leader
      of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.  She in theory
      holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall of the Tower
      at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come
      if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip
      figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there.  The
      Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in
      her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must
      the vote to depose one.  Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be
      &ldquo;of all Ajahs and none&ldquo;&mdash;all previous affiliations with
      Ajah are ignored (at least in theory).  The Ajahs have gotten fairly
      equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions.
      No Amyrlin had been raised from the Red Ajah since
      Bonwhin Meraighdin, who
      was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>'s day, except for
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>, raised Amyrlin in Tar
      Valon after a coup deposed <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>;
      the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of
      Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last the last five Amyrlins
      (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to
      the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the
      friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has
      a secretary of sorts, the
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the
      Amyrlin was raised from.  The Amyrlin Seat was held by
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she
      was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Her successor was the leader of
      the coup, <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>, raised from
      the Red Ajah.  Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the faction
      opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of
      choosing sides on the fateful day Siuan was deposed:
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>, who was outside the Tower and not
      even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time Egwene
      was Raised.  Other sisters outside the Tower, in many cases,
      did not reveal their loyalties to either Egwene or Elaida.
      Egwene was captured by forces loyal to Elaida during a partially
      successful attempt to turn the harbor chains to <i>cuendillar</i>;
      Elaida re-enlisted her as a Novice, and treated her as a disobedient,
      stubborn child.  Egwene remained defiant to the very last, trying to
      garner support from within.  Elaida stubbornly refused to acknowledge
      Egwene's warnings of a Seanchan attack; that very attack, when it
      occurred, claimed Elaida herself as a prisoner of the Seanchan.  After
      two tense days, filled with revelations of the Black Ajah, the aftermath
      of the Seanchan attack, and a near-invasion by Egwene's army, the Hall
      Selected a new Amyrlin:  Egwene al'Vere, raised from the Accepted (no
      Ajah).

  <li><a class="name" name="Gawyn">Gawyn Trakand</a>,
      p. 73&mdash;Son of
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor and brother to
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>.  He will become First Prince of the Sword
      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that
      erupted after <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>'s deposition, Gawyn
      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders
      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back
      against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and
      <a href="#Leane">Leane</a> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself
      killed <a href="#Hammar">Hammar</a> and Coulin,
      the men in charge of teaching the sword and
      for his personal training, respectively, both of which were
      Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn
      managed to kill both of them.  When he learned more of what actually
      happened, Gawyn did not know which party to support&mdash;he believed
      that anyone who opposed Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was
      wrong, but at the same time he realized he did not know all the facts
      surrounding the change in leadership.  In fact, his sister Elayne and
      her friends <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a> and
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a> side with those
      who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is
      their new leader.  He believes the rumor that <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>
      killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene
      made him promise not to.  Gawyn has made many enemies inside and outside
      the Tower, just by leading the Younglings.  He detests Rand because he
      thinks Rand killed his mother (when in fact no one did), and there is no
      telling how he will react when he finds out that Elayne actually does
      love Rand (and is carrying his twins).
      Gawyn led the Younglings on harrying parties against the
      army besieging Tar Valon; Lord Bryne was quite upset
      to find out that it was someone who had inside information about his
      tactics that was harrying him so successfully.
      At one time, Gawyn had no problem with the fact that he had killed his
      former teachers&mdash;they were rebelling against a lawfully raised
      Amyrlin&mdash;but he has since begun to feel guilty, wondering if he had
      truly chosen the just side.  He has stated that he did not like
      Elaida&mdash;she had always been cold to him as his mother's
      advisor&mdash;but he supported her because he disliked what Siuan had
      done, involving Egwene and Elayne in her plotting.  Eventually, he
      learned that Egwene herself lead the rebels, and that she had been
      captured.  He stubbornly refused to believe she could <i>possibly</i> be
      safe as a prisoner, and vowed to do anything to rescue her.  He
      eventually jumped at the chance to help Siuan mount a rescue; Egwene is
      quite angry at him (and at Siuan) for disobeying her direct orders.
      Gawyn is trying to discover what his relationship to Egwene needs to be
      as her Warder, which of course he must do before she bonds him.  He is
      finding that situation very trying&mdash;he is used to being his own
      person.  His sign is a white boar.

      p. 74&mdash;Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> in Tar Valon.  She was born the
      youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy.  She
      occasionally has the Foretelling, and as a result of a Foretelling she
      had concerning the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon
      Gaidon, she served as advisor to <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of
      Andor for her entire reign.  She later led the coup that deposed
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> and placed herself on the Amyrlin Seat
      in Siuan's place.  She distrusts anyone not of the Red Ajah (as most
      Reds do), and does not think she will ever be able to trust any member
      of the Blue Ajah again.
      Her <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> was
      <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a> of the White Ajah&mdash;she
      was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition
      of Siuan.  If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would
      not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <i>she</i> would
      have been stilled and exiled from the Tower instead of Siuan.
      She eventually removed Alviarin and raised
      <a href="#Tarna">Tarna Feir</a> in her place after Alviarin vanished for
      some months.
      Her Foretelling about the importance of Andor's royal family
      during the Last Battle occurred around the time the Succession was going
      on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became
      clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne.  Another of her
      Foretellings was to predict that <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> would
      shake the world on its very foundations&mdash;she constantly kicks
      herself for not doing something about him when he was right in front
      of her, little more than a farmboy at the time.
      Her most recent Foretelling was that &ldquo;the White Tower would be
      whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned,
      whole and stronger than ever.
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her
      anger.  The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will
      walk its grounds.&rdquo;  The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly
      accurate.  However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an
      inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family
      was not certain.  It may have meant Morgase,
      <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>, <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>, and
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> (they have all had a large role to play in
      the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old
      Royal Family, that of <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>,
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail</a>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as
      well.  After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of
      the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Her most recent Foretelling
      will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be;
      she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not
      be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that
      the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her.
      Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan (before she was
      stilled and Healed), <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>,
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and a few others could match her
      strength.  Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to
      follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last
      Battle, and tried to capture Rand al'Thor in an effort to gain similar
      control.  The only sisters that support her are those that are actually
      Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as
      Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were
      stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually
      <i>did</i> shatter).  Elaida started to build a palace for herself
      atop the Warders' old practice yard.  The building was to be about as
      tall as the White Tower.  She had no plans to be merciful to those who
      rebelled against her when she deposed Siuan&mdash;her terms were that
      the Blue Ajah no longer existed, and that any sister who followed
      Egwene must serve penance under her personal guidance before being
      readmitted to the Tower.  Elaida replaced Alviarin as Keeper with a
      sister of the Red Ajah, <a href="#Tarna">Tarna Feir</a>,
      and she has suspicions that Alviarin was trying to commit treason
      against the Tower.
      She ordered <a href="#Seaine">Seaine Herimon</a> to &ldquo;follow the
      trail of treason&rdquo; as far as it went, even to the Keeper herself.
      Seaine interpreted this as a charge to capture members of the Black
      Ajah, leading to a grave situation for Seaine, as she now has several
      Black sisters that she has uncovered and no longer feels she can trust
      Elaida.  Elaida continually ignored Egwene's warnings about a Seanchan
      attack; when the attack came, Elaida was woefully unprepared, and a
      significant fraction of the Tower was captured and made <i>damane</i>,
      including herself.  She is currently held captive as a <i>damane</i>
      named <a href="#Suffa">Suffa</a>.  She knows the weave for Traveling, and it is
      very unlikely she will be able to hold back that knowledge from the
      Seanchan.

      p. 75&mdash;Aes Sedai
      of the Brown Ajah who accompanied <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>,
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>, and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> back
      from Falme to Tar Valon.  Her Warder is named
      Tomas.  She is more interested in current events
      than the average Brown; most of them could not care less what happened
      now, only what happened years ago.  She gave Egwene the twisted stone
      ring <i>ter'angreal</i> to assist her in Dreaming, and also once told
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> that there was really no need to keep her
      in the Tower until she learned to control her ability when she was a
      novice, since she would never be able to do much with it anyway.  When
      Verin went to the Two Rivers with <a href="#Alanna">Alanna</a>, they
      helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they
      brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including
      <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>'s sister Bode.  When she and
      Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and
      decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town.  Verin is
      quite old&mdash;her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai
      means she is quite old indeed.  She communicated with
      <a href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</a>'s group of sisters in Tear,
      but has since departed their company.
      Verin always seems to follow her own agenda, though
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> once said she had always trusted her, even
      though she knew she could trust no one.
      She and Thomas have been waiting for Mat for some time; she is the one
      who posted fliers of him and <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> throughout the
      countryside, hoping to scare one of them up.
      Known to virtually no one until an hour before her death, Verin was
      a member of the Black Ajah.  She was given the choice one day to take
      her oaths to serve the Dark One or be executed.  She took the oaths to
      save her own skin; once inducted, she carefully but persistently studied
      the Black Ajah&mdash;how it is organized, what its rules are, and, most
      importantly, who its members are.  She found Tomas, who was a Darkfriend
      seeking a way out, and he agreed to become her Warder.
      She wrote down all of her notes, including a list of about 200 sisters
      she had discovered, in a dense tome that she gave to Egwene
      al'Vere after drinking poison.  The poison would kill her in one hour,
      which released her from her oath:  &ldquo;I swear not to betray the
      <a href="#Dark">Great Lord</a>, to keep my secrets until the hour of my
      death.&rdquo;  Her bravery allowed Egwene to gut the Black Ajah among
      the rebels, starting with her
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      <a href="#Sheriam">Sheriam Bayanar</a>, and a Sitter
      for the Blue Ajah, Moria Karentanis.
      Verin also left a note with <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a> just before
      going to the Tower to spill her secret to Egwene; she made him promise
      not to open it until several days had passed, but that if he opened it
      he had to do what it said.  The contents of this letter are not
      known.

      During the Age of Legends, Mesaana was told she was unfit to
      do research at the Collam Daan, but was capable of teaching others.  She
      spent her years teaching until the Bore was opened and she dedicated her
      life to the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.  During the War of Power, she
      created &ldquo;schools&rdquo; for the children, at which she taught
      the children to spy on their parents and other such things.  After her
      release from the Bore, Mesaana set herself up in the White Tower, where
      she could control events without anyone suspecting she was behind them.
      She has been cooperating with <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> and
      <a href="#Demandred">Demandred</a> to some extent,
      and taught <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</a> to Travel.  She
      was displeased that Alviarin had ordered <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>

      She is from the Red Ajah, and was appointed by
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> after <a href="#Sheriam">Sheriam</a> left
      the Tower.  She is tall stocky, and has a square face.
      She keeps her black hair in a bun.
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> describes her as stern, but fair.
      Elaida herself used to go to her occasionally for
      &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; penanaces&mdash;these penances were actually
      being assigned by <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</a> in an attempt to
      keep Elaida in her place.
      Now that Alviarin has been supplanted, Elaida sends Alviarin to
      Silviana's study for daily penance.
      Silviana was the sole voice in the Tower (other than Egwene) who spoke
      out against Elaida&mdash;she went as far as calling Elaida out, in front
      of the Hall, for her actions as Amyrlin, which she pointed out were
      only useful for sowing dissent and distrust among the sisters.
      She claimed the Red Ajah should be embarrassed by having one of their
      own behave that way as the leader of the Aes Sedai.  Elaida managed to
      shift some of the blame away from herself, then prompty imprisoned
      Silviana in the deepest cells in the Tower dungeons.
      Egwene was impressed enough with Silviana's behavior&mdash;both in
      doing her duty as she saw it by beating Egwene, no matter how much she
      resented doing it, and in being brave enough to stand up to Elaida when
      no one else would&mdash;that she appointed her to be
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>
      in the reunited Tower.  She has transfered her dedication and competence

  <li><a class="name" name="Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>,
      p. 76&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      the Blue Ajah with shoulder-length hair.
      Born in Tear to a fisherman, she was sent to the White
      Tower on the first boat to leave after she discovered she had the
      ability to channel inborn, according to Tairen law.  As a novice, she
      was good friends with <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a>, and was
      present at Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the
      Rebirth of the <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>.  After being raised to the
      shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and
      guiding the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, and eventually came to
      lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being
      raised to the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  She was only thirty
      years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest
      Amyrlin to that point.  She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in
      recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations.
      Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all.  When her twenty-year connection
      to the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> was discovered, she and her
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a>,
      were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</a>.
      Siuan and Leane escaped with <a href="#Min">Min</a>'s help and found the
      rebel Aes Sedai in Salidar.  Siuan hoped to regain some of
      her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from
      Elaida&mdash;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to
      match, and she knows much that she thought would be of use.  In one of
      her viewings, <a href="#Min">Min</a> saw that Siuan would have to remain
      close to Gareth Bryne&mdash;if she did not, both
      of them would die.  Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now
      realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the
      rebel army.  She later realized that the viewing was related to the
      attack on the Tower by the Seanchan.
      Siuan had a Warder named Alric, but he
      was murdered by Elaida when Siuan was deposed.  After coming to Salidar,
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> discovered how to restore Siuan's ability
      to channel, at least partially.  This resurrected a part of her bond
      with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding
      by the Oath Rod.  She could lie as well as any child, at least until she
      re-swore the Three Oaths shortly before the Tower was reunited.
      She served as an advisor of sorts to the new Amyrlin in Salidar,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>, but though she put on a
      fa&ccedil;ade of hating the work, she was actually one of Egwene's
      foremost agents.  The fact that she was Aes Sedai, not to mention one
      who was stilled and Healed again, made other sisters tend to be
      oblivious to that fact.  She was pushed very hard by Elaida as a novice.
      While Egwene was being held prisoner in the Tower, Siuan was charged
      with keeping the factions among the rebels&mdash;headed by
      <a href="#Romanda">Romanda Cassin</a> and
      <a href="#Lelaine">Lelaine Akashi</a>,
      respectively&mdash;from usurping the rebellion and placing
      <i>themselves</i> on the Amyrlin Seat.  When the Seanchan attacked,
      Siuan decided she had had enough of Egwene's stubborn insistance not to
      rescue her.  She easily convinced <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a> to come with her,
      and eventually convinced Gareth Bryne to come with
      as well, on two conditions:  she bond Bryne as her Warder, which she
      did immediately, and that she marry him.  The second condition has yet
      to be met.  Bryne saved her life when a Seanchan assassin creeped up
      behind her while she was Healing Bryne's troops; he thrust his sword
      into the apparition's chest area, knowing that he would die if the blow
      did not land, and saved her life.  She then saved <i>his</i> life by
      Healing him of the poison the assassin injected right before dying
      himself, thus satisfying Min's viewing.  Siuan has an unusual Talent:
      she can see <i>ta'veren</i>.

      knife, in the fashion of her native Altara.  She has touches of white
      at her dark temples which emphasize a thin, age-faded white scar.  Only
      a Warder could match her for scowling.  She has held her chair in the
      Hall for forty years, and has worn the shawl for over 150 years.
      Everyone knows to be wary of her temper.  She was born the daughter of
      an innkeeper, and was first trained by the Daughters of Silence (an
      organization similar to, but shorter-lived and smaller than, the
      Kin)&mdash;she was the only one of them to ever obtain the shawl.
      She is good at taking charge of things, and immediately took charge
      of the organization to fetter out Darkfriends in the Tower with

      fled to Salidar with the rest of her Ajah.  She led the group of six
      sisters that held most of the influence in Salidar, despite not being
      part of the Hall of the Tower.  Her tilted, green eyes were used to
      intimidate novices and Aes Sedai alike.  She became the
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a> among the rebels.
      She was very efficient, but she
      hated the paperwork involved with being Keeper, and was often heard
      muttering under her breath that she wished she were still Mistress of
      Novices.  She lost a considerable amount of weight in recent months.
      She was beaten, apparently as a way to extract
      information, by an unknown assailant in the weeks before her death.
      She often wished she had chosen the Brown Ajah, which would have allowed
      her to isolate herself from the Tower, politics, and stress in
      general.  Known to almost no one (except <a href="#Verin">Verin</a>) until
      shortly before she was exposed and executed by Egwene, Sheriam was
      secretly of the Black Ajah, and fought to raise Egwene to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> by order of the Chosen.
      Egwene watched Sheriam's execution personally, listening to her confess
      to several incredible crimes in her final minutes.  Her fiery red head
      left her body along with those of about fifty other sisters among the
      rebels.  <i>Editor's note:  Those who remember, as I do quite vividly,

      to a rose garden in northern Ghealdan, but has since left it due to the
      difficulty of growing decent roses with the weather the way it used to
      be.  She refused two appointments to the Hall of the Tower, when
      refusing even once is unheard of.  She also refused to become head of
      the Green Ajah.  It is said that she has had more Warders than most
      sisters have had shoes.  She has more strength than anyone in a thousand
      years except perhaps for <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> and
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.  Although she is a Green, she has

      unknown to most, the men she captures tend to live longer after being

      Sedai.  According to <a href="#Min">Min</a>, Cadsuane will teach
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and the Asha'man something&mdash;they will not
      like it, especially not from her, but they will have to learn it.  She
      is the oldest Aes Sedai alive.  Cadsuane wears many ornaments in her
      hair, all of which are <i>ter'angreal</i> she has collected over the
      years&mdash;<a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> calls it a &ldquo;paralis net.&rdquo;
      One of them is a reservoir, or a well&mdash;it &ldquo;stores&rdquo;
      <i>saidar</i> for later use in places where one might not be able to tap
      the Source, such as inside the Guardian at Far Madding, her hometown.
      It is not known whether it works inside an Ogier <i>stedding</i>, too.
      Another vibrates in the presence of men who can
      channel; it is likely this ornament that has allowed her to capture so
      many men to be gentled.  Another resembles a weather vane, and moves to
      point in the direction that someone last touched the Source.
      There are many others, including three that she

      Cadsuane may be a Darkfriend, but based on her actions and thoughts so
      far that seems unlikely.  <a href="#Verin">Verin</a> told Rand that she
      thinks Cadsuane can be trusted, and Verin is also not a Darkfriend
      (though she played one in public, of course).
      Cadsuane has, reluctantly, agreed to be Rand's advisor, provided he
      adheres to a proper level of conduct.  She is just shy of 300 years
      old.
  <li><a class="name" name="Pevara">Pevara Tazanovni</a>,
      p. 83&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Red Ajah.  She is short for a Kandori, and quite plump, but
      tough.  She goes against all Red Ajah custom to openly say that Warders
      would make a Red sister's job easier.  She and her friend since
      novicehood, <a href="#Seaine">Seaine</a>, began the hunt for Darkfriends
      in the Tower.  Seaine approached her not only because they were friends,
      but because Seaine's family was killed by Darkfriends when she was
      young.  She joined the Red Ajah because its task was one which involved
      being outside the Tower often, and she considered it more likely to be
      able to find and bring to justice the Darkfriends that killed her family
      and others like them.  She now leads the organization of sisters in the
      White Tower to ferret out Black sisters, along with
      <a href="#Saerin">Saerin Sedai</a>, who seized control away from
      Seaine as soon as she knew what they were about.
      Pevara myseriously disappeared from the Tower&mdash;in reality,
      she was one of the sisters leading the embassy of sorts to the Black
      Tower in which Red sisters offered to bond Asha'man as Warders.
      Pevara is presumably still at the Black Tower, though it is not known
      why she has not returned to the White Tower.  Her seat in the Hall has
      been filled by another sister, either permanently or until she
      returns.

  <li><a class="name" name="Mat">Matrim (Mat)  Cauthon</a>,
      p. 84&mdash;A young
      man from Emond's Field.  He is <i>ta'veren</i>.  Along with his good
      friends, <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>,
      he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after Winternight.
      On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar
      Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried
      with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai
      Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence.  These
      gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the
      land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests:  a foxhead
      medallion that protects him from women's channeling, a way out of the
      land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the
      gaps in his memory.  Mat's <i>ta'veren</i> qualities manifest themselves
      particularly well with random events, such as dice games&mdash;he almost
      never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted.  He has
      found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his
      newfound memories, he can win almost every battle he fights quite
      decisively.  He has four sisters, including Eldrin
      and Bodewhin, who were 16 and 17, respectively, when
      Mat left Emond's Field.  His
      father Abell is one of the best archers in the Two
      Rivers, probably in the World.  Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying
      concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&mdash;his
      collection would surprise anyone.  In the Waste, he met a woman named
      Melindhra,
      a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan.  However, she was
      not the <a href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>, who Mat was
      destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill
      him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill
      her to save his own skin, but regretted it deeply.  He also has a scar
      along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to hang him&mdash;which was
      also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &ldquo;to
      die and live again.&rdquo;  He created an army called the Band of the
      Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old
      Manetheren, and served in a way as Rand's personal general&mdash;this
      worked well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even
      <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>, who has earned his reputation as
      one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and
      because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a
      bath.  Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> and
      prevent them from getting themselves killed.  While there, he was
      cornered by <a href="#Tylin">Queen Tylin</a>, who gave him little choice
      but to become her lover.  When the Sea Folk and the Seanchan did battle
      in the city, he made his escape, leaving Tylin tied up under the bed so
      it looked &ldquo;official&rdquo;&mdash;Tylin was found torn limb from
      limb, obviously by the <i>gholam</i>, which was no doubt sent to kill
      Mat.  In the process of leaving, Mat also took several <i>sul'dam</i>
      and <i>damane</i> (who were subsequently freed from their collars), and
      even kidnapped <a href="#Tuon">Tuon</a>, the
      <a href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a> herself.
      Mat traveled with
      <a href="#Luca">Valan Luca</a>'s show to keep out of Seanchan
      sight for quite some time.
      Tuon has now completed Mat's unwitting marriage ceremony;
      he is now among the highest of the Seanchan ruling class,
      the <a href="#Ravens">First Prince of the Ravens</a>,
      despite his insistence that he will fight the Seanchan during any battle
      if such battle is necessary.
      Mat is as yet unaware that Tuon is (metaphorically) dead, and that
      his wife is now the <a href="#Empress">Empress</a> of Seanchan,
      <a href="#Fortuona">Fortuona</a>.  Mat still has one major task ahead of him:
      answering <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>'s letter to <a href="#Thom">Thom</a>,
      which asks him to help rescue her from the Eelfinn.
      Mat is currently in Caemlyn, asking <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> for help
      producing <a href="#Aludra">Aludra</a>'s dragons, what most of us would call
      cannons.

<h3>Chapter 5:  Writings</h3>
<img src="../chapters/snake.gif" width="89" height="86" alt="Serpent icon">
  <li><a class="name" name="Sleete">Sleete</a>,
      p. 103&mdash;Limber,
      long-armed Warder to <a href="#Hattori">Hattori</a> with rough-hewn
      features.  His face is filled with sharp lines.  He has a cleft chin, a
      hooked, once-broken nose, and jutting cheek bones.
      He is a Blademaster.  Shadows cover his eyes.
      He was one of two Warders who was with the eleven Aes Sedai that escaped
      Dumai's Wells, though Sleete barely escaped with his skin.
      His story could have been drawn from legends:  he had lain wounded for
      hours before managing to pull himself into the saddle by the reins;
      the horse carried him, nearly unconscious, for hours before arriving
      at a village, where the villagers had been tempted to sell him to a
      group of bandits.  The mayor's daughter argued for his life,
      convincing everyone that only Darkfriends would seek wounded Warders.
      The villagers hid him, and the girl nursed him to health.
      He was forced to leave in secret, as the girl had taken a liking to
      him, but in return he hunted down the bandits and killed them so they
      would never trouble the village again.
      Hattori told him she would not take a second Warder unless Sleete
      believed the person to be worthy.
      He is one of the only Warders to have ever bettered
      <a href="#Lan">Lan Mandragoran</a>, back when Lan still practiced with
      the other Warders.  Sleete beat Lan in two of their seven duels, and
      Lan is widely considered the best Warder and Blademaster in the world.
      However, <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a> beats Sleete in every duel, even
      when Sleete has a capable partner.
      Sleete asked Gawyn if he would be interested in being Hattori's second
      Warder; Gawyn politely declined.

      p. 104&mdash;Aes Sedai of the White Ajah.  She has worn the shawl for twenty
      years.  She was murdered by an unknown assassin.  Like all the other

  <li><a class="name" name="Seaine">Seaine Herimon</a>,
      p. 108&mdash;Sitter
      for the White Ajah in Tar Valon.  She grew up in Altara, and has a
      fondness for cats.  She is described as stately, with thick black hair
      and eyebrows and watery blue eyes.
      She was the daughter of a Lugard furniture maker,
      and is a bit above average height.  When the Hall was arguing
      over who to raise as <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</a> years back, it was
      deadlocked over four candidates who had each worn the shawl about fifty
      years; the Hall wanted an Amyrlin that was younger than the eighty or
      more years than were common.  Seaine suggested
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>,
      then a young Blue sister that had worn the shawl for only
      ten years; she was eventually raised.  Later, Seaine was charged by
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> to find Darkfriends in the Tower; Elaida
      hopes to expose <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</a> on the suspicion that
      she is Black Ajah.  She and her friend since novicehood,
      <a href="#Pevara">Pevara</a>, have successfully captured and bound with
      the Oath Rod a member of the Black Ajah, and have since dug out more
      Black sisters, even revealing that Galina Casban,
      head of the Red Ajah herself, was secretly Black.
      Seaine eventually found that she was set to her task because of a
      misunderstanding:  Elaida asked her how she was getting along
      &ldquo;with discovering proof that Alviarin entered a treasonous
      correspondence with the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
      Elaida's exact words were, &ldquo;We can never be sure who has the
      shadow of treason in her heart, Seaine.  Why, I suspect that someone
      arranged for an order of mine to be countermanded.  And I have reason
      to believe that someone has communicated privately with
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>; to what end, I cannot say,
      but that surely is treason against me, and against the Tower.
      I charge you to follow the stench of treason,
      no matter where it leads or how high,
      even to the <a href="#Keeper">Keeper</a> herself.  Yes, even to her.
      What you find, whoever it leads to,
      you will bring before the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> alone,
      Seaine.  No one else must know.&rdquo;
      Seaine interpreted this to mean Darkfriends in the Tower,
      and therefore assumed Elaida could not be a Darkfriend.
      She and her associates were no longer so sure after realizing what she
      had actually said, so they stepped carefully.
      <a href="#Ferane">Ferane</a> wanted Seaine raised Amyrlin when Elaida was
      captured.  Seaine and her cohorts have since become some of
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>'s strongest supporters.

      surrounding <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>'s deposition and

  <li><a class="name" name="Darlin">King Darlin Sisnera</a>,
      p. 114&mdash;High Lord
      of Tear, one of those who went into hiding in Haddon Mirk once the
      battle at Cairhien was over.  <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> says he almost
      admired him&mdash;he opposed Rand from the very start, fleeing the Stone
      of Tear when it fell and trying to rouse resistance among the rural
      nobles.  He was considering <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>'s offer of
      support if he declared himself king of Tear, until he was made the
      Steward for the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> in Tear.  Rand
      figures that this will keep the nobles scheming among themselves so much
      that they will not have time to make trouble for him.
      Rand later made Darlin the first King of Tear in memory.
      He has a prominent nose, and is about a head shorter than Rand.
      He has a short black beard, and close-cropped hair.
  <li><a class="name" name="Semirhage">Semirhage</a>,
      p. 117&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, she was one of the
      best Healers ever known.  She was called to all corners of the world to
      Heal people that others thought beyond help.  However, she was sadistic;
      she exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for
      her Healing services.  Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from
      them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall
      of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of
      being either severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her
      &ldquo;pleasures.&rdquo;  She chose instead to pledge for the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>, and created one of the most oppressive and
      pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power.
      She became an expert at sadism and torture; she considers her greatest
      achievement to be a weave which removes the victim's blood and replaces
      it, instantaneously, with another liquid that causes every nerve in the
      body to fire with pain simultaneously&mdash;the victims typically
      survived about an hour.
      After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark
      One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai.
      She also sent the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that
      Sammael sent.  She was as tall as most men, and
      wore black most of the time&mdash;perhaps because
      <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> always wore white.  It is often joked (or
      used to be, when the Forsaken were still bound) that when it rained
      during the daylight that the Dark One was beating her.
      According to <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin</a>'s memories,
      Semirhage always enjoyed a challenge.
      She had an uneasy alliance with <a href="#Mesaana">Mesaana</a> and
      <a href="#Demandred">Demandred</a>
      before she was captured by <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> after her unsuccessful
      attempt to capture him.  She had been posing as
      Anath Dorje, <a href="#Tuon">Tuon</a>'s new Truthspeaker.
      It is a virtual certainty that she murdered the previous Truthspeaker in
      order to gain the office.  She was eventually given a Domination Band by
      <a href="#Shaidar">Shaidar Haran</a>, and used it to capture
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>.  She Compelled Elza Penfell,
      who was a Darkfriend, to help her control him by wearing the other
      bracelet.  She attempted to force Rand to kill <a href="#Min">Min</a> by
      choking her to death&mdash;she would have succeeded, but Rand's
      connection to <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a> apparently let him seize the True
      Power, which Rand used to kill Semirhage and Elza with balefire.
  <li><a class="name" name="Ishamael">Ishamael</a>,
      p. 117&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was the most powerful of the Forsaken, and during the Age
      of Legends he was a prominent philosopher and theologian named
      Elan Morin Tedronai.
      He was never really bound inside the Bore, and led the
      hidden forces of the Shadow for the three thousand odd years from the
      end of the War of the Shadow to the present.  He took credit for such
      things as convincing the then insane
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>
      to kill everyone he loved, pursuading the dying
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a> not to accept the Aes Sedai
      Healing that might have saved his life, sending the Trollocs out of the
      Great Blight during the Trolloc Wars, and many other events in history
      that turned out poorly.  When the rest of the Forsaken were freed,
      Ishamael kept them away from each other's throats.  He confronted
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> at the Eye of the World, where he was severed
      from the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s bonds; he confronted him again
      at Falme where Rand put his sword through him and melted it, but not
      after Ishamael gave Rand a wound that he has not been able to recover
      from yet; and he confronted Rand in the Stone of Tear after he took
      <i>Callandor</i>.  Rand killed Ishamael after beating him sore by
      plunging <i>Callandor</i> into his heart.  His body rotted quickly, but
      it was proof that Ba'alzamon, which he called himself
      to the public, was a human being, and not the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.  Ishamael has been resurrected in
      the person of the mysterious <a href="#Naeblis">Nae'blis</a>,
      <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a>.

      p. 117&mdash;A Myrddraal of special abilities who escorts the Chosen
      (i.e., Forsaken) to the Pit of Doom to converse with the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.  He
      is head and shoulders taller than all other Myrddraal, who are the
      height of an average man and all the same height.  His name means
      &ldquo;Hand of the Dark&rdquo; in the Old Tongue; most Myrddraal names
      come from the Trolloc tongue.  He is given special consideration; the
      ceiling of the entrance to the Pit of Doom does not brush his head as it
      does everyone else's.  He is the only known servant of the Dark One to
      have power over the Chosen (other than <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a>,
      who is one of the Chosen himself).
      It was Shaidar Haran himself who freed <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> from her
      captivity; he may have set Semirhage up to be killed because the
      Dark One (or perhaps Moridin) was displeased with her.

      Children of the Light; his identity was known only to Niall.  His skills

      her from Caemlyn as per <a href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</a>'s suggestion.
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> hopes that she will still support her, but

  <li><a class="name" name="Ellorien">Lady Ellorien Traemane</a>,

      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> during the Succession, and one of
      Morgase's best friends.  Morgase exiled her from Caemlyn as per

      what she did and support her when she comes to Andor to reclaim her
      throne, or at least support <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> in her claim.
      She and her House have effectively disappeared from the face of Andoran
      politics for the last few weeks.
      Morgase remembers exiling her, but she does not remember <i>why</i>

      p. 122&mdash;Wise One of the
      Jumai sept of the Shaido Aiel.  She is the widow of the last two chiefs
      of the Shaido, Suladric and
      <a href="#Couladin">Couladin</a>, and served as chief of the Shaido
      since Couladin's death.  Everyone seemed to know that she had no
      intention of letting another prospective chief be sent to Rhuidean.
      She has green eyes.  She knows that the easiest way to power for herself
      is to attach herself to men who already hold power; she even envisioned
      marrying <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> (against his will) to gain power
      through him.  She led her clan (and any Aiel deserters
      that joined her) through Ghealdan, where they were sent from Kinslayer's
      Dagger by Sammael.  She constantly wanted more
      <i>gai'shain</i>&mdash;her goal was to indenture the entire world.  She
      had taken a fancy to wearing silk, and wore nothing else.  She
      is tall, has pale green eyes, and hair like spun gold.  She would be
      beautiful except for the strong hint of avarice around her plump mouth.
      Little about her seemed Aiel beyond her eyes, skin, and hair.  She also
      wore rings on every finger, and non-Aiel-made jewelry everwhere else.
      All of these were seized when she was captured by
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> and his Seanchan allies.
      Her clan now stands in ruin, with no one to blame but herself.
      Sevanna is known to have been the only person to be almost refused her
      eventual status as a Wise One; part of their training is that they must
      declare that they are no longer students, and Sevanna declared herself
      to be done with her training after it had barely begun.
  <li><a class="name" name="Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>,
      p. 123&mdash;Man who came to
      Caemlyn just as riots sprang up throughout the city.  He joined and led
      the faction that restored order in the city, and upon
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>'s return, he gave her her kingdom in one
      piece, as it was when she left.  Allegedly, she was so happy that he had
      done this that she made Gaebril her new advisor (and lover).
      However, during <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>'s trip through Caemlyn to deliver
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>'s letter, Mat overheard Gaebril ordering
      someone to kill Elayne and anyone else with her&mdash;he tried to find a
      way to report this information to Morgase, but ended up telling Elayne.
      Gaebril was discovered to be <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a>, one
      of the Forsaken, who has a preference to having pretty women around him.
      His &ldquo;pretty woman&rdquo; was Morgase, and he planned to wrest
      control of Andor from her.  Morgase realized he was controlling her and
      left the country so quickly a rumor sprang up that she had been killed;
      when Caemlyn was taken by <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and Rahvin killed,
      the rumor changed to say that Rand had killed Morgase, instead of
      Gaebril.

      signifying service to <a href="#Sevanna">Sevanna</a>.  Her time as

      knew Faile planned to escape, and wanted to help&mdash;provided she
      could escape as well.  She was once a noble, it appears.  She grew up
      in Amadicia.  Her face is plump, but still haggard from her

      Agelmar Jagad,
      <a href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</a>, Gareth Bryne,

      would not invade both countries.  He also tried to expand Amadicia's
      borders into parts of Ghealdan.  His headquarters were in Amadicia, and
      he ruled there even above King Ailron, although
      this was not spoken of openly.  Niall once offered a treaty with
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor, offering Whitecloak
      assistance to retake her throne in exchange for Whitecloak presence in
      Caemlyn and elsewhere in Andor, a presence that Morgase had not allowed
      even a fraction of during her reign.  Niall was killed by his alleged
      Spymaster, Abdel Omerna, who claimed he had gone
      against everything the Children stood for by allowing Morgase to avoid
      being put to the question.  He was replaced by
      <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>, who also killed Omerna.  Rumor puts

      them but immediately went back to his room and reswore the old oath in
      the old style (cutting his arm with his sword, indicating that his blood
      will be shed before the Queen's will).  He loves his queen more than his
      life, and now serves as her personal bodyguard.  He went looking for her
      himself when Morgase was captured by the Shaido, and brought word back
      to <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> that the Seanchan were also hunting the

      offer of escape; she will serve her year and a day, as prescribed by
      <i>ji'e'toh</i>, and then walk away.
      The Shaido to which she was sworn was killed by <a href="#Gaul">Gaul</a>
      during the battle; Gaul had to kill about a dozen Aiel warriors in order
      to get to Chiad, and was somewhat disappointed to find that Bain was
      also <i>gai'shain</i> to one of them.  Chiad is little more than a
      finger taller than her adopted first-sister.  She and Bain are using
      every opportunity to give Gaul a proverbial poke in the ribs while in

      rarely smiles, and reminds Mat of a compressed spring.  He commands
      about half of Mat's cavalry in the Band of the Red Hand, and acts as the

      She is also called the <a href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>,
      the woman Mat was told he will marry.  Mat later
      kidnapped her (in a matter of speaking), and she traveled with him under

      She is very small&mdash;short and slender.  She is,
      however, 20 years old, about the same age as Mat.  She has very long
      eyelashes.  She was presumed dead by <a href="#Suroth">Suroth</a>, but
      Suroth took no chances: she sent parties out to find her, and kill her.

      tricks&mdash;<a href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</a> once saw him performing
      at the Royal Court, and to say that he was impressed was to say that
      the sun is hot.  He also
      carries several concealed knives up his sleeves, in his boots, and in
      various other locations on his body; this practice seems to have spread
      from Thom to <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>, <a href="#Min">Min</a>, and
      <a href="#Faile">Faile</a>.  Thom was originally a bard in

      her husband <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a> died, he was the
      Queen's lover.  During his run from a Fade at Shadar Logoth, he was
      injured, and now walks with a limp because of it.  Thom is getting old,
      such that he is starting to realize that he cannot do the backflips and

      never felt comfortable around Aes Sedai since his nephew,
      Owyn, was
      gentled by the Red Ajah.  Thom is an expert in the Game of Houses; in
      fact, his girlfried Dena
      was killed by Cairhienin soldiers because they
      thought he was trying to play <i>Daes Daemar</i> against the Royal
      House.  He has recently taken to traveling with Mat and his entourage,
      ever since hooking up with him again in Ebou Dar.
      Thom received a letter from <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> after her
      battle with <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> stating that she was still
      alive in the land of the Eelfinn.  He and Mat have plans to attempt

      believed one of her colleagues,
      Tammuz, was to blame.  She was cast out
      of the Illuminators' Guild, and when she refused to stop practicing the

      by <a href="#Mat">Mat</a> and <a href="#Thom">Thom</a> in a barn, and as
      a sign of gratitude she gave Mat a roll of fireworks.  She later came to
      Ebou Dar, and asked Mat to find her a bellfounder.  He was knocked out
      during the battle and thus missed the bellfounder, but Aludra escaped
      and she now travels with Mat's entourage.  Since the Seanchan destroyed
      the Chapter House of the Illuminators in Tanchico, Aludra may be the
      last Illuminator alive.  She is planning to make dragons, what most of
      us would call cannons.  She has ordered Mat to conscript every

      Four Winds, Guardian of the Sea of Storms, High Seat of House Mitsobar,
      until her recent death.
      Her kingdom was small, and she only ruled a portion of it; the rest was
      governed by nobles who were not necessarily loyal to her.  She was the
      second from her House to sit on the throne&mdash;this was the maximum
      traditionally, and the only House to hold it for four generations fell
      so fast from power that it could not recover.  She was advised by
      Merilille Ceandevin of the Gray Ajah.  She was
      a widow, and did not plan to marry again.  She took an interest in
      <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>, and contrary to Mat's usual tactic of
      chasing women, <i>she</i> chased and caught <i>him</i>.  The
      two were lovers for some time.  When the Seanchan invaded her nation,
      she cooperated with them out of necessity&mdash;they let her keep her
      position of authority, but she was a puppet of the Crystal Throne.
      When the Sea Folk fought the Seanchan, destroying much of Ebou Dar in
      the process, Tylin suggested Mat use the opportunity to escape the city,
      and tie her up under the bed to make it look like he had to restrain
      her to escape.  While she was bound and gagged under the bed, the
      <i>gholam</i> came, presumably to kill Mat, and she fell easy prey to
      it.  She was found by <a href="#Suroth">Suroth</a>'s people the next
      morning, torn limb-from-limb.

      and misses him immensely since he was spun out normally while she was
      ripped out.  She lived four lives between the founding of the White
      Tower and the Trolloc Wars, one of which involved her and Gaidal Cain
      <i>helping</i> to found the Tower.  She is slowly forgetting the details
      of those lives, which terrifies her.  She has lived as a soldier, a
      forest woman, a general, a guard, a noble thief, a lady, a peasant, a
      killer, and a savior.  This is, however, the first time she has been a
      Warder.  She is nothing like the stories say she is supposed
      to be like, except that she <i>is</i> pretty.

      eyes, straight black hair, a round face, and is very imposing.
      Unfortunately, Sumeko's abilities in Healing have caused her to

  <li><a class="name" name="Min">Elmindreda (Min)  Farshaw</a>,
      p. 187&mdash;A young woman from Baerlon.  She is lithe and slight of build,
      and keeps her dark hair in short ringlets.  She has dark, deep,
      worried-looking eyes.  She has a special ability that few
      besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras around people,
      especially around Aes Sedai, Warders, and Asha'man, that foretell their
      futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when
      she does, the viewings <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of how
      and when.  Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included
      herself:  he was destined to fall in love with three different women,
      one of which was herself.  She usually dressed in attire reserved for
      men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a
      miner.  However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she
      began to wear more traditionally feminine attire&mdash;still coat and
      trousers, but cut to emphasize female characteristics.
      Min was in Tar Valon
      helping <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> with her viewings' information when
      Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and
      <a href="#Leane">Leane</a> from the dungeon.  She accompanied the two
      former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for
      Caemlyn with Salidar's embassy to Rand.  Once in Caemlyn, she brought
      information to Rand about the embassy there, and its intentions.  She
      has only had one viewing that ever failed, which concerned
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>; since Moiraine is believed dead, she
      hopes that her viewings might be wrong at least once in a while.  Min is
      one of only three women that can rightfully call herself a lover to the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon Reborn</a>, and she is now bonded to Rand via a
      Warder bond that she shares with the other two,
      <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a> and <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>.  She
      is fond of reading books by the late <a href="#Fel">Herid Fel</a>, a
      philosopher who worked in Rand's school of thought and was killed by a
      <i>gholam</i> or <a href="#Slayer">Slayer</a>,
      presumably because he had stumbled upon
      information crucial to the defeat of the Shadow.  She had a viewing of
      Elayne just before the door closed that Elayne would become pregnant
      with twins; she told half the palace before Elayne herself knew.&hellip;
      When Rand was collared briefly by <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a>, she forced
      Rand to strangle Min&mdash;she nearly died until Rand siezed the True
      Power and destroyed Semirhage with balefire.  She still has nightmares
      about the incident.  Min has been studying Fel's books, thinking that
      they hold the key to winning the Last Battle.  She knows she cannot
      fight herself, nor contribute directly in any other way, but she vows to
      solve the mystery of how to seal the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> away.

      She has a temper, but she will admit she is wrong if
      she is.  She taught novice classes on &ldquo;the nature of
      reality.&rdquo; Her Warder is Vitalien.
      She has a secret love of writing poetry&mdash;she would die of shame if
      Vitalien ever discovered that she compares him to a leopard and other
      graceful, powerful animals in her poems.
      She assisted in <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>'s kidnapping,
      was captured and shielded after the battle at Dumai's Wells, and is now
      sworn to Rand.  According to
      <a href="#Min">Min</a>'s viewing, she will fall in love.  She is so

      Owein, died in the Two Rivers while scouting the
      Whitecloak camp.  She later found that bonding Rand was a grievious
      error; not only is it impossible to Compel him in comparison to most
      Warders (she compared it to attempting to uproot an oak tree with her
      bare hands), but she constantly feels the pain he experiences from the
      wound in his side, perhaps even more severely than he feels it.  She
      vanished from Tear mysteriously, leaving no Travelling residues

      was controlled by one of the women.  Merise took away his dragon pin at
      first, claiming it was not appropriate for him to wear it in lieu of his
      new responsibilites as her Warder&mdash;Jahar was very angry with her
      for this, and she will eventually have to learn that he is much stronger
      than she is, and she needs to give him respect appropriate to that
      position.  Jahar was instrumental in exposing

      near-insane risk, but one that was evidently worth taking.  It appears
      that his trust was not misplaced.  <i>Editor's note:  Narishma mentioned to
      Rand that he had not told him everything about how to disarm the wards

      p. 210&mdash;Aiel of the
      Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.  Formerly a Maiden of the Spear,
      she was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because she had
      the ability to channel inborn.  Her spears were melted down into other
      objects, which themselves could not be weapons, to be given away as
      gifts to the people she hated most&mdash;the metal from one spear is
      now used in a belt buckle for <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>.
      She has green eyes, and is of age with Rand and <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>.
      She is more than pretty with her dark reddish hair.
      Aviendha is one of the three women
      in <a href="#Min">Min</a>'s viewing of Rand&mdash;she also saw that
      she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings
      in Rhuidean.  She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the
      wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became
      unavailable and she tried bathing as &ldquo;wetlanders&rdquo; did; Rand
      came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she
      panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway to southern Seanchan (she
      does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible,
      into the middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she decided she could
      not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the
      night in each other's arms before coming back.  Aviendha says a similar
      incident will not occur, and punished any Maiden who made a crack about
      it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of
      the world on another continent is a different subject entirely).  She
      felt <i>toh</i> toward <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> for violating her
      trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her
      sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once
      again.  She is not certain what she thinks of a <i>second</i>
      sister-wife in Min, but she seems to accept the idea at least.  She has
      been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the
      weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is
      difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way.
      She has, however, mastered the art of untying weaves&mdash;a feat which
      was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken.  She
      and Elayne have adopted each other as first-sisters.  Aviendha has a
      special ability in making wards against eavesdropping; it is unlikely
      even the Forsaken could breach one of her wards, and certainly no one
      could do so without her knowing it immediately.
      Aviendha was staying with Elayne at the Royal Palace in Caemlyn,
      but she was summoned away by the Wise Ones to complete her training.
      While in the Palace, she discovered a new Talent:  the ability to
      sense the function of a <i>ter'angreal</i> simply by holding it in her
      hands.  Aviendha was very frustrated by the Wise Ones' treatment of her
      when she returned from her stay with Elayne; they seemed to be punishing
      her for no reason she could ascertain, and continually asked her opinion
      of matters as if to test her responses.  It turned out that this was the
      last part of her training to become a Wise One:  she must tell the Wise
      Ones she is one of them, or at least demand to be treated as an equal by
      them.  They were pushing her harder and faster than they typically push
      apprentices because they had no time:  she was needed at the Last
      Battle, and they had no time to wait for her to become ready on her own.
      She is currently at Rhuidean, going through the crystal columns that are
      the <i>ter'angreal</i> of Aiel history.  She expects she knows what she
      will find there, and is not looking forward to watching what she
      perceives to be the failure of her people.
      She is due to arrive at Rand's encampment with
      <a href="#Rhuarc">Rhuarc</a> and much of the rest of her clan soon.

      Typical of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.
      She served as <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>, despite being of a different Ajah than
      Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced to choose Alviarin in
      order to gain the support of the White Ajah when bringing charges
      against <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>; unknown to Elaida, this also brought
      her the support of the Black Ajah.  Without Alviarin as Keeper, the
      White Ajah would most likely have been divided over whether to depose
      Siuan, and only the Red would be behind Elaida, which would most likely
      have led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of
      the Red Ajah.  It still may, since Elaida is rapidly losing her support
      among the sisters.  If Alviarin's loyalties are ever revealed, it is
      likely nothing will save either of them.
      Alviarin has been shown how to Travel by
      <a href="#Mesaana">Mesaana</a>, and one of her first uses of it brought
      her to Tremalking for several weeks, during which Elaida removed her as

      were spies; she refused to let Elaida speak with
      Meidani, who was one of them.  She has since been
      estranged from the White Ajah; her fellow Whites blamed her for
      destroying their connection to the Amyrlin, and humiliating herself and
      her Ajah in the process.  She was sent to
      <a href="#Silviana">Silviana</a> for daily beatings.

      promised her that she is still his praised servant;
      he marked her for his own with an invisible mark on her forehead that
      only Alviarin can sense.
      She was among those identified as Black by <a href="#Verin">Verin</a>; she fled
      the Tower some time ago, and her whereabouts are unknown.
      She was one of the Black sisters who attacked <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> in
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>.  She threw an errant fireball at her, which
      Egwene dodged by disappearing and reappearing behind Alviarin; the

      forehead in the Cairhienin style.  She and Seaine were charged with
      determining whether it was possible to fool or circumvent the Oath Rod;
      they discovered an alteration to the Mask of Mirrors that would allow
      the user to distort the <i>words</i> they were saying, so that they
      could in fact say anything at all (with approximately the same length
      sentences, at least) and have everyone else hear something else.

  <li><a class="name" name="Moghedien">Moghedien</a>,
      p. 228&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  Her name means &ldquo;Spider&rdquo; in the Old Tongue.  She
      always works from safety, attacks from safety, and will run unless she
      can do so.  She developed a command of <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i> that
      surpassed even <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a>'s mastery&mdash;in the
      real world, Lanfear was more powerful, but even she could not top
      Moghedien in the World of Dreams.  After being released from the Bore,
      Moghedien eventually found herself in Tanchico, in the Palace of the
      Panarch of Tarabon.  While there, she chanced upon
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a>, who was trying to save the
      Panarch at the time and take the seal on the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s prison from its hold in the Palace.
      She and Nynaeve fought in
      a duel to the last, and Nynaeve managed to better Moghedien, much to the
      surprise of both of them.  She managed to escape Nynaeve's tied off
      shield, and on their next encounter, this one in <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>,
      she ripped <a href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</a>'s soul out of the World of
      Dreams after Birgitte almost killed her.  On her third encounter with
      Nynaeve, Nynaeve managed to trap Moghedien with an <i>a'dam</i>.
      Moghedien remained bound by that <i>a'dam</i> in Salidar, disguised as
      Marigan, but was released by
      Halima.  Halima was actually one of the Forsaken,
      and she took Moghedien to Shayol Ghul to be bound by a
      <i>coursouvra</i>, a Mind Trap, controlled by
      <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a>.  Typical of her ways, she has been
      keeping a low profile.  Her present coordinates are unknown.

      anger.
  <li><a class="name" name="Demandred">Demandred</a>,
      p. 228&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He is handsome, with a hawk-like nose and dark hair.
      Second-best seems to be the story of his life.
      He was born Barid Bel Medar one day after
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, and from the first day
      proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin's accomplishments, almost equal
      Lews Therin's strength, and almost equal him but never surpass him in
      everything.  He became one of the Light's greatest generals, once again
      second in command under Lews Therin.  Demandred believed that he was
      Lews Therin's intellectual and military superior, and was furious when
      Lews Therin was chosen to lead the Light's forces over him during the
      War of the Shadow.  He developed a burning hatred of Lews Therin, and
      finally dedicated his life to the Shadow so he could finally better Lews
      Therin&mdash;he believed the Shadow would eventually win the war, since
      Lews Therin was commanding the Light's armies, and that if he, Barid Bel
      Medar, had been chosen to command them, the Light would have prevailed.
      When Demandred was freed from the Bore, he transferred his hatred of
      Lews Therin intact to the new recipient of his soul,
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>.  Demandred was recently told by the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> to lead his plan to convert or destroy
      Rand, and promised him to be <a href="#Naeblis">Nae'blis</a> if he
      succeeded.  However, since <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a> has been
      declared Nae'blis, he is now only ordered to obey Moridin.  Demandred's
      assumed identity and whereabouts are unknown,
      but he has formed an alliance of sorts with
      <a href="#Mesaana">Mesaana</a> and <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a>.  Demandred never smiles,
      and never seems to enjoy anything; <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a> once heard him
      say that he would laugh the day he could snap the neck of Lews Therin.
      According to <a href="#Lannis">Lannis</a>, a Blue Ajah scholar, Demandred is the
      only Forsaken who exceeds Mesaana in anger.
      <i>Note:  Demandred's
      identity in the world is still not definite.  There are some suggestions
      that he is one of the Tairens, one of the Seanchan, or even acting
      behind the scenes, directly or indirectly controlling
      <a href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</a> and the Asha'man.</i>

      more barrier to the woman fleeing (since Bethamin supposedly cannot

      He was wounded in the fighting in Arad Doman&mdash;his left leg had to

      retirement when news of <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> and
      <a href="#Leane">Leane</a> came to her.  She led one of the two
      factions in the Hall of the Tower under <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>.
      She grew up in Far Madding.  Romanda was also the First Weaver, the head

  <li><a class="name" name="Lelaine">Lelaine Akashi</a>,
      p. 310&mdash;Tall,

      her.  She was a Sitter in the White Tower for forty years until
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> was deposed.  She is quite old.  She led one of the
      two factions that divided the Hall of the Tower under
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>.  Lelaine had a <em>strong</em> desire to
      hold the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> herself, enough that once
      that Egwene was captured she nearly tried to seize it.
      She took to feigning support for Egwene to establish power in the
      Hall, anticipating that Egwene would not return.
      She is capable, strong-willed, and decisive.  She is not beautiful, but
      she <i>is</i> pretty, particularly when she smiles.  She is slender and
      graceful, with no gray in her dark hair.  Her face is almond-shaped,
      with full lips.  She represented the Blue Ajah at <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>'s
      test for the shawl.
  <li><a class="name" name="Myrelle">Myrelle Berengari</a>,
      p. 315&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Green Ajah with an elliptical face and olive skin.
      She is olive-skinned and beautiful, with long black hair and rounded
      curves.  She is
      young (she has worn the shawl for about fifteen years) and known for
      her temper.  She is now the Captain-General of the Green Ajah of the
      Tower-in-exile.  She has five Warders named Nuhel,
      Croi, Avar, <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>
      (<a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>'s old Warder), and
      Llyw (Kairen's old Warder).
      She treats all of them as husbands in
      defiance of all law and custom, inside the Tower and out.  She fled the
      White Tower when <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> was deposed, along with most
      of her Ajah.  She was one of the six sisters who held much of the power
      in Salidar despite not being part of the Hall of the Tower.  She
      received <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>'s bond after
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>'s death, bringing her Warder count to
      four, at least until <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> is ready to have him
      as a Warder, and later saved Kairen's Llyw as well.
      She seems to be the resident expert on saving Warders;
      four of her five (Nuhel, Avar, Lan, and Llyw)
      were previously bonded to other sisters.
      She claims this is because she hates watching Warders die once
      their Aes Sedai is dead.  Nynaeve's last task before being raised
      &ldquo;officially&rdrquo; was to demand that Myrelle pass Lan's bond to
      her.  She reluctantly did so, after being threatened.

      p. 343&mdash;Old man from Low Caemlyn.  There's a man like him in every

      be born, grow up, and die, and willing to talk of all those years if
      you got enough drink in them, and often if you did not.  The stubble on
      his face is dappled silver, he wears a lopsided cap, his patched coat
      had once been black, and the red-and-white insignia on his pocket is
      too faded to read.  The insignia may be from some sort of military
      service; the scars on his cheek and neck seem to support that idea.

      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> has ever seen.  Just being around him
      made Nynaeve uncomfortable.  He and Birgitte are no longer tied to each
      other thanks to <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a>'s tearing Birgitte
      away from <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>, and she fears she will never meet

      p. 365&mdash;High Seat
      of House Northan.  He is tall and lean, has bony arms, an engaging grin,
      merry brown eyes, and an eagle's beak of a nose.  He is not much older
      than sixteen.  He thinks <a href="#Arymilla">Arymilla</a> is
      incompetant, and pledged the support of his House to

      performed in the Palace.
  <li><a class="name" name="Catalyn">Lady Catalyn Haevin</a>,
      p. 365&mdash;High
      Seat of House Haevin.  She is a dark-eyed young woman, though barely
      more than a girl.  She pledged the support of her House to
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>.  She is very presumptuous and snooty,
      especially for someone who had not even heard of
      Gareth Bryne (Elayne claims that miners in Baerlon
      had heard Lord Bryne's name).  She is somewhat plump, and <em>very</em>
      proud; Elayne considers her to be ungovernable.  Her sign is a blue
      bear.  She was invited to the opera <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> had performed in
      the Palace.
  <li><a class="name" name="Sylvase">Sylvase Caeren</a>,
      p. 365&mdash;Lord Nasin's granddaughter and
      heir.  She is sturdy, of medium build, placid, unemotional, and quite
      pretty except for the expressionless look.  She appears to have a cow's
      wits to accompany her cow-like expression.
      Actually, she rarely speaks.  Her blue eyes appear vapid.  Despite her
      appearances to the contrary, she is <i>quite</i> cunning; she buries it
      deeply.
  <li><a class="name" name="Ispan">Ispan Shefar</a>,
      p. 367&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Black Ajah, formerly of the Blue.
      She grew up in Tarabon, and has dark hair.
      She was captured by <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> in the Rahad.
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> recovered a silver ring worked in
      braided spirals from her; it allows the bearer to enter
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i> by channeling Spirit into it.  Ispan was executed,
      messily, along with her interrogator <a href="#Adeleas">Adeleas</a>.  The murderer
      was either <a href="#Careane">Careane</a> or <a href="#Sareitha">Sareitha</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Temaile">Temaile Kinderode</a>,
      p. 371&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Black Ajah, formerly of the Gray.  A fragile woman from
      Cairhien with very big, blue eyes and a face like a fox.  She always
      spread pain evenly in her mediating.  She left the Tower with
      Liandrin with the first group of sisters to
      publicly admit themselves Black Ajah.  <a href="#Yukiri">Yukiri</a>
      does not like her much.  She is currently held prisoner in the dungeons
      of the Royal Palace in Caemlyn.  She escaped with Darkfriend help and
      attacked <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> when Elayne attempted to trick
      <a href="#Chesmal">Chesmal</a> into revealing the Shadow's plans.
  <li><a class="name" name="Eldrith">Eldrith Jhondar</a>,
      p. 371&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Black Ajah, formerly of the Brown.  She often
      looks distracted, as many Browns do.  She was put in charge of the
      group that left with Liandrin after
      <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a> left them.
  <li><a class="name" name="Mellar">Captain Doilin Mellar</a>,
      p. 373&mdash;Guard who
      slew <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>'s assassins.  He cut the first's head
      off, <i>threw</i> his sword at the second and speared him with it, and
      took the poisoned dagger from the third and killed him with it.  He is
      wiry, has a sharp face, and is coldhearted, though he smiles a lot.  He
      is fond of teasing women.  He claims to have been a merchant's guard,
      then a mercenary, then a Hunter for the Horn.  He is now a lieutenant in
      the Queen's Guards, and in gratitude, Elayne made him the captain of her
      bodyguard.  He has dark eyes a narrow face that is not pretty or
      handsome.  He moves with a swordsman's grace, and is very strong.
      Mellar claims to be from Andor, near Baerlon, and he claims to have
      fought on <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>'s side during the Succession.
      Half the palace has accepted the rumor that he is the father of Elayne's
      twins, though he himself may be unaware that this rumor exists.
      Unbeknownst to Elayne or practically anyone else, he also answers to the
      name <a href="#Hanlon">Daved Hanlon</a>, a Darkfriend.  To him, a name
      is akin to a coat&mdash;to be changed regularly and to suit the
      conditions.  Elayne grew more than suspicious of his loyalties, and
      eventually had <a href="#Hark">Hark</a> follow him to see who he was meeting.
      It was the Black sisters; Elayne arrested him immediately.  He was
      broken out recently; in the subsequent fight with Elayne, he killed
      <a href="#Eldrith">Eldrith</a> and <a href="#Temaile">Temaile</a> rather than let them slow
      him down.

      Slayer, in Isam's form, is muscular and tanned, with thick arms,

  <li><a class="name" name="Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      p. 429&mdash;Essentially the secretary to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.
      The Keeper is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah the
      Amyrlin was raised from, and wears a stole of the color of her Ajah
      instead of the striped stole of the Amyrlin.  The post was held by
      <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a> of the Blue Ajah until a coup deposed
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> and stilled both Siuan and Leane.  Her
      successor was <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a>
      of the White Ajah, despite the fact that Siuan's successor was from the
      Red.  The Keeper for the Aes Sedai who fled the Tower when
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> was raised Amyrlin named a Keeper of the
      Chronicles of their own, <a href="#Sheriam">Sheriam Bayanar</a> of the
      Blue Ajah.  In theory, the Keeper of the Chronicles serves the Amyrlin
      and speaks for the Amyrlin; she is all but separate from her Ajah,
      although less so than the Amyrlin Seat herself.  However, both Keepers
      during the division of the Tower tried to expand their powers over the
      Amyrlin they served, although for vastly different
      reasons&mdash;Alviarin essentially tried to weaken Elaida and have
      herself or another Black sister raised in her place after Elaida was
      deposed; Sheriam tried to overstep <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> because she had a
      hard time thinking of Egwene being anything more than the frightened
      novice that came to her study not so long ago, and her orders from the
      Shadow were to <i>support</i> Egwene, as it was assumed she would be
      weak and easy to control.  Alviarin was later deposed and replaced
      by <a href="#Tarna">Tarna Feir</a> of the Red Ajah.
      Sheriam was similarly deposed when she was exposed as being of the Black
      Ajah by <a href="#Verin">Verin</a>.  When Elaida was captured by the Seanchan

      p. 429&mdash;Slender, black-haired, dark-eyed novice; she is about
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>'s age.  She was a refugee from Ghealdan.
      She has already developed several Talents, including the ability to see
      <i>ta'veren</i> and Foretelling, although what she Foretells is usually
      in such language that only poets can understand it.  Her potential
      exceeds that of all Aes Sedai currently alive, with the exception of
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>, and Nynaeve.
      She has a limited ability to make <i>cuendillar</i>, but she is
      impatient in learning.  She is very arrogant and can also be deceitful;
      she once tried to blackmail <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>,
      <a href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</a>, and Nisao.  She
      used the fact that she could Foretell to be even more arrogant and
      demand even more special treatment.  When Egwene refused to grant her
      that treatment, she ran away to the White Tower, thinking they would let
      her progress at the pace she wanted.  She could not have been more
      incorrect, of course, and her life in the Tower was no doubt even more
      abysmal than it was before.  It would have gotten even worse if a sister
      ever found out that she lied about her age; she is too old to be entered
      into the novice book by traditional Tower law.
      When Egwene was captured, Nicola became one of her foremost adherents
      among the novices; Nicola gathered enough support for Egwene amongst
      the novices that they supported Egwene more than many of the sisters in
      the Tower.  She has recently been raised to the Accepted, now that the
      Tower is reunited.  She and <a href="#Nissa">Nissa</a> brought the news to
      Egwene that the Tower was meeting without informing her first.

      and still suffers from terrible judgment.

  <li><a class="name" name="Leane">Leane Sharif</a>,
      p. 557&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      the Green Ajah, formerly of the Blue.
      She grew up in Arad Doman, and has coppery skin.  Just
      as her family members were training her in the seductive ways of Domani
      women, Leane found that her life would take a different direction:  she
      could channel <i>saidar</i>, and would do so with or without teaching.
      She became an Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue Ajah, and was eventually
      raised to <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>.  During the coup
      led by <a href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</a> and
      <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a> that deposed Siuan, Leane was
      thrown in the dungeon and stilled.  Leane tried turning to her seductive
      side to try to replace what she lost in stilling; she was out of
      practice, but did well enough.  She eventually convinced the Aes Sedai
      in Salidar to let her stay with them and maintain the network of
      eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as Keeper.  She was later Healed by
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and restored to some of her former
      capacity for using the One Power.  The Hall of the Tower in Salidar
      decided that since she had been stilled, she was no longer Aes Sedai for
      that time and thus all of her titles and choice of Ajah were null and
      void.  Instead of petitioning to re-enter the Blue Ajah, she asked the
      Green Ajah if it would accept her; it did, and she became the first
      sister to ever switch Ajahs.  Her eyes-and-ears as Keeper are retained
      by her; she was the only Aes Sedai to plant spies in the city itself.
      These spies were very useful in determining both what is going on in Tar
      Valon and what the Ajahs were leaving out of their reports to
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>.  She has considerable strength with Earth,
      and is the second best at making <i>cuendillar</i>, after Egwene
      herself.  While carrying out Egwene's plan to turn the harbor chains to
      <i>cuendillar</i>, she was captured and held in the dungeons below the
      Tower.  She was allowed only one dress, the one in which she was
      captured, which she washed every third day in the remains of her bath
      water.  Now that the Tower has been reunited, Leane is held in some
      esteem among the novices and Accepted&mdash;not only was she stilled yet
      still channels, she changed Ajahs!

      the head of Rand's school of male channelers, now dubbed the Black

      during the chaos surrounding the deposing of
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>,
      and eventually was escorted out of Tar Valon by Siuan and
      her traveling companions.  Before he was gentled, he was of considerable
      strength, and attracted quite a following of loyal soldiers.
      <a href="#Min">Min</a> still has viewings of him with a halo over his
      head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a figure of great

      declaring himself the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, most likely
      with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would bring more
      glory than gentling a simple man who could channel.

      in the middle.  This is the typical Seanchan style for those &ldquo;of
      the Blood.&rdquo;  Suroth was determined to redeem herself after
      High Lord Turak's mishap at Falme&mdash;she did
      not want to have to explain a failure that was not hers to the
      <a href="#Empress">Empress</a>.  She gathered all of the Seanchan ships
      that fled Falme so they would not go back home; she then retook portions
      of the mainland again, but was prevented from taking Illian by
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and his Asha'man.  Known to few, Suroth is
      Atha'an Shadar, &ldquo;Those Bound to Shadow&rdquo; (a Darkfriend), and
      is high in their ranks.
      Suroth attempted to send Elbar to kill
      <a href="#Tuon">Tuon</a> so that Suroth herself would become the
      legitimate ruler of the Seanchan this side of the Aryth Ocean.
      Tuon arrived carrying Elbar's head; she then made Suroth

      Banner-General of the Deathwatch Guards, and commander of about 2300
      Seanchan troops.  He is 42 years old, born to weavers, and the property
      of Jalid Magonine, a craftsman in Ancarid.  Furyk
      started training for the Deathwatch Guards when he was fifteen.  He was
      cited twice for heroism, and mentioned in dispatches three times.  After
      seven years, after her birth, he was named to <a href="#Tuon">Tuon</a>'s
      personal bodyguard, though that was not her name at the time (and using
      that name now would be an insult to her).  He was one of only three
      survivors of an attempt on Tuon's life, and was subsequently chosen for
      officer training.  Later, he was injured again saving Tuon from
      assassins; she gave him a doll, her most prized possession at the time.
      Several years later, Karede was named to the
      <a href="#Empress">Empress</a>'s personal bodyguard, and sent with
      High Lord Turak and the <i>Hailene</i>.  He kept
      Tuon's doll for over ten years until it was destroyed in the Great Fire
      of Sohima.  He has since requested to be on Tuon's bodyguard again no
      fewer than three times.  Tuon, now <a href="#Fortuona">Fortuona</a>, has granted his
      wish now that she has left <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>'s presence.

      p. 710&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose her name for
      herself, which means &ldquo;Daughter of the Night&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue.  She was born
      <a href="#Mierin">Mierin Eronaile</a>, and was
      very strong in the One Power.  She worked at the Collam Daan, the
      primary facility for research into the One Power.  Her final discovery
      there was what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that
      could be harnessed by men and women alike&mdash;this source turned out
      to be the emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s prison.  She and another Aes Sedai named
      Beidomon
      bored into the prison, creating what is now referred to as
      simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and
      leading to the War of the Shadow.  Around this time, Mierin formed a
      relationship with <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who headed
      the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful man
      she had found.  Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found
      that she only wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility
      of power for herself through him.  Mierin never let go of him, and when
      he later met and married Ilyena Moerelle, she
      tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by
      any means.  Eventually, she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to
      the Shadow, most likely to finally get back at Lews Therin for leaving
      her.  She declared as her territory the World of Dreams,
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>, using it to ends now unknown.  She transferred
      her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin's soul's new body,
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, after being freed from the Bore.  She
      first appeared to him as a young woman named <a href="#Selene">Selene</a>,
      but disguised her
      appearance as a slightly less beautiful (but still stunning) woman.
      Almost a year later, Lanfear found that Rand had been
      &ldquo;unfaithful&rdquo; to her, and she tried to kill him.  Before she
      could, she was pushed through the twisted stone doorway
      <i>ter'angreal</i> leading to the lands of the Eelfinn by
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, becoming trapped.  Lanfear has since
      been reincarnated as Cyndane and fitted with a
      <i>cour'souvra</i>, a Mind Trap, held by <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a>.
      She is not as strong as she used to be, but still stronger than

      The four of them are quadruplets, and their status as the children of
      the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> gives them elevated privileges
      among the Aiel.  Despite being quadruplets, he and his siblings look
      very little alike.  Janduin takes after his mother's side&mdash;tall and

  <li><a class="name" name="Arymilla">Arymilla Marne</a>,
      p. 728&mdash;Brown-eyed Andoran noble with a habit of fainting.  She
      opposed <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> during the Succession.  The only
      real reason <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> kept her around in Caemlyn was to
      push others into supporting <a href="#Dyelin">Dyelin</a>; no one wanted
      Andor in the hands of Arymilla.  Once <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>
      returned to Andor, she exiled Arymilla as her mother had.  However,
      Arymilla learned of where <a href="#Naean">Naean</a> and
      <a href="#Elenia">Elenia</a> were being detained in Murandy and rescued
      them.  This debt of sorts bound House Arawn and House Sarand to support
      Arymilla's claim to the Lion Throne.  She had the support of five
      major houses of Andor at one point.  She is plump, verging on stout,
      has a vacuous smile, and brown eyes that are almost always wide with
      interest.  After her failed attempt to take the Throne, Elayne had her
      imprisoned; she is still plump despite her captivity.  She might even
      be pretty if not for the rags she now wears.

      &ldquo;lacks the wit&rdquo; to be queen, and Elayne too
      immature&mdash;she is also not above causing &ldquo;accidents&rdquo;

      He keeps the front of his head shaved and powdered, and keeps the gray

      White Tower under <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>.  Elaida had sent her to Salidar to

      their numbers.  She has long, pale, yellow hair, a strong jaw, and blue
      eyes that could freeze the Sun.  She was a wilder, and had her block
      beaten out of her by Galina Casban; she and Galina
      were pillow friends as novices and/or Accepted, but Tarna rebuffed her
      advances once she gained the shawl.  She is as
      jumpy as a novice, but has a cold manner.  She came to
      <a href="#Pevara">Pevara</a> with a suggestion that Red sisters bond
      Asha'man as Warders.  They have since gone to the Black Tower to seek

      was the Black (not Red) Ajah that Galina knew she would choose.  It
      would have fit with the idea of most Aes Sedai in the Tower being Black.

      books.  There is also a reference made to the character
      of Modrellein as the hero of Andor who rode into the middle of the
      battle 700 years ago, reversed the retreat, rallied the army, and won
      the battle&mdash;that is who she was confused with.</i>

  <li><a class="name" name="Tigraine">Lady Tigraine Damodred</a>,
      p. 860&mdash;First
      wife of <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>, and
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>'s mother.  She was the
      <a href="#DH">Daughter-Heir</a> to the Throne of Andor and daughter of
      <a href="#Mordrellen">Queen Mordrellen</a>, but she disappeared.  Her
      disappearance set of the Third War of Andoran Succession.  When
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> was in the Royal Palace in Caemlyn, several
      people commented on his striking resemblance to Tigraine; this is no
      coincidence, since Tigraine is Rand's mother.  She fled to the Aiel
      Waste upon a warning from Gitara Moroso to become
      a Maiden of the Spear, and gave birth to Rand when the Aiel were
      fighting near Tar Valon.  Her maiden name was Mantear.

      p. 860&mdash;By Andoran tradition, the first-born daughter of the
      Queen is her heir to the throne.  The Daughter-Heir is traditionally
      sent to Tar Valon to receive training from the Aes Sedai, although until
      the previous Daughter-Heir, <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>, most have been
      too weak to get beyond novice training.  Now that Elayne is Queen, there
      <i>is</i> no Daughter-Heir in Andor.
