<h3>Chapter 1:  The Hook</h3>
<img src="../chapters/helmet.gif" width="90" height="90" alt="Helmet icon">
  <li><a class="name" name="Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</a>,
      p. 11&mdash;Uncrowned
      king of Malkier, a nation now swallowed by the Great Blight, and the
      son of <a href="#Akir">al'Akir</a> and <a href="#Leanna">el'Leanna</a>,
      the last king and queen of Malkier.  He is very tall, with long hair
      that he wears back with the <i>hadori</i>, a braided leather strap
      traditionally worn by Malkieri men.  At his birth, shortly before the
      Trollocs overran Malkier and the Blight consumed his homeland, Lan was
      given four gifts (while still in his cradle): a gold signet ring, a
      locket, a sword, and an oath. Lan and his surviving Malkieri companions
      are the last of their people. He prefers to avoid Aes Sedai when
      possible.  Lan has experience fighting the Aiel on the
      Shienaran Marches, long before the Aiel War even began.  He is quite
      practiced in the <i>ko'di</i>, the Oneness, a concentration aid he uses
      to clear his mind for battle and other crucial situations.

  <li><a class="name"">Dark One</a>,
      p. 12&mdash;Name, used in every land, for
      <a href="#Dark">Shai'tan</a>, because using his real name causes bad
      luck (at best) to anyone who speaks it.

  <li><a class="name" name="Basram">Basram</a>,

      at his post during his rounds.
  <li><a class="name" name="Jaim2">Jaim</a>,
      p. 13&mdash;Gray-bearded soldier.
      <a href="#Lan">Lan</a> found him asleep at his post, still standing up,
      eyes open.  He denied being asleep, but Lan knew&mdash;other seasoned
      veterans knew the trick of sleeping with their eyes open, too.
  <li><a class="name" name="Bukama">Bukama Marenellin</a>,
      p. 14&mdash;<a href="#Lan">Lan</a>'s teacher, one of the original 20 men charged
      with the task of carrying the infant prince of Malkier to safety when
      the nation was overrun; he is the only one still alive.  Bluff and
      broad, he is taller than most men, almost as tall as Lan.  His hair is
      solid gray, which he wears cut to the shoulder according to Malkieri
      tradition, held back by the <i>hadori</i>, a thin braided leather cord.
      He has blue eyes.
  <li><a class="name" name="Dark">Shai'tan</a>,
      p. 15&mdash;Source of all evil,
      complete antithesis of the <a href="#Creator">Creator</a> in every way.
      He was imprisoned by the Creator at the moment of Creation in a prison
      just outside the Pattern.  This prison was bored into during the Age of
      Legends; the Dark One's touch on the world produced new waves of hate,
      crime, and violence that had never been seen before.  An attempt to free
      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow, a war which
      ended only with the sealing of the Bore by
      Lews Therin Telamon and the Hundred Companions.
      During the moment of sealing, the Dark One's counterstroke tainted
      <i>saidin</i> itself, beginning the Time of Madness.
      The seals on the prison were made of <i>cuendillar</i>,
      an indestructible substance, but nonetheless are beginning to weaken.
      The Dark One may touch the world again soon.  Speaking his true name
      draws his attention and causes bad luck, so he is known by a plethora of
      euphemisms, most commonly as simply, &ldquo;The Dark One.&rdquo;  Some,
      including <a href="#Bukama">Bukama</a>, believe that merely
      <i>thinking</i> his true name is enough.

  <li><a class="name" name="Creator">The Creator</a>,
      p. 15&mdash;Maker of the
      world, the True Source, everything in existance.  At the moment of
      Creation, the Creator sealed the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> in a
      prison at Shayol Ghul to keep him from influencing the world.

      p. 15&mdash;Legendary
      emperor who lived about a thousand years ago.  He conquered most of the
      known world, and the present-day nations were carved from his
      empire.
  <li><a class="name" name="Rakim">Rakim</a>,
      p. 17&mdash;Grizzled old Saldaean
      soldier.  He has a hoarse voice and a ragged scar from an Aiel arrow to
      his throat.  He likes to show off the scar when he is drinking.  He
      considers himself lucky to be alive, and he is, but because of that he
      takes somewhat unnecessary chances and boasts about his luck.
  <li><a class="name" name="Emares">Lord Emares</a>,
      p. 17&mdash;General in the
      forces against the Aiel from Tear.  He discovered a group of Aiel
      that followed to the east.  He sent a message to <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>
      to the effect that he intended to serve as the hammer that crushed the
      Aiel into Lan's troops, who would serve as the anvil.

      man among <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>'s troops.  The young Kandori is an
      efficient, experienced soldier, and an archer of rare skill.  An almost
      cheerful killer, he often laughs while he fights.

      use for <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>.  It means, roughly, &ldquo;One Man
      Alone&rdquo; or &ldquo;Man Who is an Entire People&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue.

<h3>Chapter 2:  A Wish Fulfilled</h3>
<img src="../chapters/snakewheel.gif" width="96" height="97" alt="Wheel of Time icon">
  <li><a class="name" name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>,
      p. 26&mdash;Leader of the
      Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a king or queen.  Her authority is
      immense&mdash;rulers of all nations will obey a summons to the
      Amyrlin, even if they will spend the entire journey devising a plan to
      kill her while there.  The Amyrlin, once raised, is considered to be
      &ldquo;of all Ajahs and none&rdquo;&mdash;she wears a stole striped with
      the seven colors of the Ajahs.  The current Amyrlin is
      <a href="#Tamra">Tamra Ospenya</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah.

      <a href="#Sierin">Vayu, Sierin</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a>,
      p. 26&mdash;One of
      the Accepted.  She grew up in the Sun Palace in Cairhien, a niece of
      <a href="#Laman">Laman</a>, King of Cairhien, and half-sister of
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>, the husband of the Queen of
      Andor.  Upon entering the White Tower, she quickly formed a friendship
      with <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, daughter of a Tairen fisherman.
      The two have been progressing at nearly identical paces ever since.
      Moiraine is <i>very</i> short&mdash;short even for a Cairhienin
      woman&mdash;and has very pale skin.
      She has been known to flash her temper on occasion.
      Both of her parents are dead; her mother died when she was very young.
      Like her friend Siuan, she was born with the spark of <i>saidar</i> in
      her.  She will some day become one of the strongest Aes Sedai in the
      Tower.  Moiraine has great respect and admiration for
      <a href="#Tamra">Tamra Ospenya</a>.

  <li><a class="name" name="Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>,
      p. 26&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.  She grew up on a fishing boat in Tear, and was sent on the
      first boat bound for Tar Valon the day it was discovered she had the
      spark of <i>saidar</i> inborn, in accordance with Tairen law.  Her
      parents are now dead, her mother dying when she was very young.  Upon
      arriving at the Tower, she very quickly became friends with
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a>, and despite the large gap
      between their incomes and lifestyles as children, they found they had a
      remarkable amount in common.  The two moved at nearly the same rate
      through their work with the Power, but Siuan seems to learn things like
      history, language, and politics at a much faster rate.  In fact, she
      arrived at the Tower barely able to read, and now she teaches
      introductory classes in the Old Tongue.  She has very fair skin, clear
      blue eyes, and is only a hand taller than Moiraine.  She has a talent
      for puzzles.  Like Moiraine, she will some day become one of the
      strongest Aes Sedai in the Tower.

  <li><a class="name" name="Mareed">Azil Mareed</a>,

      the Tower Guard.  His reports are available only to Aes Sedai.
  <li><a class="name" name="Tamra">Tamra Ospenya</a>,
      p. 28&mdash;Watcher of the
      Seals, the Flame of Tar Valon, the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.
      She was raised from the Blue Ajah.  She is always fair and just, which
      are not necessarily the same thing.  It is said that her stare can make
      stones move.  Her <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> is
      <a href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</a>, also raised from the Blue Ajah.

  <li><a class="name" name="Gitara">Gitara Moroso</a>,
      p. 28&mdash;<a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>
      under <a href="#Tamra">Tamra Ospenya</a>.  She is always
      just, usually fair, but rarely kind.  She is tall and almost voluptuous.
      Raised from the Blue Ajah, she still considers herself a Blue.  Her hair
      is pure white, and she wears ivory combs in it.  Rumor has it that she
      is over 300 years old.  When she has the Foretelling, it is always
      strong, and she is rumored to have them frequently.

      p. 28&mdash;Secretary of sorts for the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.
      By tradition, the Keeper is chosen from the same Ajah as the Amyrlin
      was raised from.  However, the Keeper represents the Amyrlin, not the
      Ajah she is part of.  The current Keeper is
      <a href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah.

  <li><a class="name" name="Temaile">Temaile Kinderode</a>,
      p. 29&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.  She and <a href="#Brendas">Brendas</a> were assigned to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>'s chamber before
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> and <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> took over.
  <li><a class="name" name="Brendas">Brendas</a>,
      p. 29&mdash;One of the Accepted.
      She and <a href="#Temaile">Temaile</a> were assigned to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>'s chamber before
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> and <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> took
      over.  She is usually quite sensible.
  <li><a class="name" name="Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>,
      p. 32&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Red Ajah.  She was the only woman besides
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> and <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> to finish novice training in
      less than three years.  She finished Accepted training in less three
      years as well, also a record.  Moiraine describes her as a
      &ldquo;detestable woman.&rdquo;  She currently serves as advisor
      to the Queen of Andor, a post she has held for three years.
  <li><a class="name" name="Elin">Elin Warrel</a>,
      p. 33&mdash;Novice on guard
      duty outside the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</a>'s study.  She is very
      slender.  <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> caught her reading
      <i>Hearts of Flame</i>, a romance novel of sorts.  The book is
      considered inappropriate for novices.  She is three years older than
      Moiraine.
  <li><a class="name" name="Merean">Merean Redhill</a>,
      p. 34&mdash;Plump,
      motherly Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah, and
      <a href="#Novices">Mistress of Novices</a> under
      <a href="#Tamra">Tamra Ospenya</a>.  She has a plump chin, and more gray
      in her hair than not.  She is fairly
      tall&mdash;<a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>'s head comes up to her chin.  She
      is very strong in the One Power, and has a way of discovering that which
      people wish to keep hidden. She had been Aes Sedai for over 100 years by
      the time Moiraine's great-grandmother was born.  She has no Warder.

      She serves as both a disciplinarian and a shoulder to cry on for girls
      who need either.  The current Mistress of Novices is
      <a href="#Merean">Merean Redhill</a> of the Blue Ajah.

      Rebirth was Foretold by <a href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</a>, just before
      the moment of her death.

<img src="../chapters/fish.gif" width="79" height="85" alt="Fish icon">
  <li><a class="name" name="Meilyn">Meilyn Arganya</a>,
      p. 40&mdash;Aes Sedai
      of the White Ajah who gives private classes to
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, though
      Moiraine fears she will miss those classes if the sisters do not return
      from the battle soon.  She has silver-gray hair and a thrusting chin.
      She is one of the most respected women in the Tower; it is said that no
      one has a bad word for her.  She has a smooth, emotionless face and
      startling blue eyes.  She is one of the only Whites to have a Warder.
      She has worn the shawl for over three hundred years, and is the
      strongest Aes Sedai alive, except for <a href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</a>.

  <li><a class="name" name="Larelle">Larelle Tarsi</a>,
      p. 40&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      unknown Ajah with long hair and coppery skin.  She instructed Moiraine
      as a novice; she always had a way of asking the last question you wanted
      to hear.  She is quite strong in the One Power, as strong as
      <a href="#Merean">Merean</a>, and has no Warder.
  <li><a class="name" name="Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>,
      p. 43&mdash;According to
      the Karaethon Cycle, the Prophecies of the Dragon, the man who is the
      Rebirth of Lews Therin Telamon, the <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>.  It is
      said he will be Reborn at mankind's greatest hour of need to save the
      world. His Rebirth was Foretold by <a href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</a>
      just before her death; in fact,
      the shock of the Foretelling was what killed her.

  <li><a class="name" name="Akarrin">Akarrin</a>,

      <i>anyone</i> who is not following her lead.
  <li><a class="name" name="Myrelle">Myrelle Berengari</a>,
      p. 50&mdash;Accepted
      from Altara.  She earned the great serpent ring the same year
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> and <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> earned
      theirs.  Olive-skinned and beautiful, she is almost as tall as Siuan.
      She is gregarious and mercurial, with a boisterous sense of humor and
      a worse temper than Moiraine.  Moiraine and Myrelle began novice
      training with heated words, but they eventually became close friends.
  <li><a class="name" name="Tarna">Tarna Feir</a>,
      p. 53&mdash;Accepted from
      northern Altara.  She is taller than <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>.  She
      has pale yellow hair and cold blue eyes.  Tarna is very arrogant, and
      lacks a sense of humor entirely.  She spent nine years as a novice, and
      gained the great serpent ring one year before <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>
      and <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> did.  She had few friends as a
      novice, and has even fewer as an Accepted.
  <li><a class="name" name="Aledrin">Aledrin</a>,
      p. 56&mdash;Aes Sedai of the
      White Ajah.  <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> heard her say that
      <i>all</i> Accepted were to test for the shawl immediately at the
      assembly in the Oval Lecture Hall where <a href="#Tamra">Tamra</a>
      announced her plan to pay bounty.  She is very excitable.
  <li><a class="name" name="Zemaille">Zemaille</a>,
      p. 56&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.  She is slim, and very dark, with straight black hair to her
      waist and various black tattoos on her hands.
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> thinks it is likely she will choose the
      Brown or perhaps the White Ajah when raised.  She is one of the Sea
      Folk; there are only four Sea Folk sisters among the Aes Sedai, and all
      are Browns.  Two of them are <i>very</i> old, as old as
      <a href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</a> was before she died.  She spent ten
      years as a novice, and eight so far as Accepted.
  <li><a class="name" name="Aisling">Aisling Noon</a>,
      p. 57&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.  She is very tall.  She is a rarity in the Tower, one of the
      Tuatha'an, the Traveling People.  She spent five years as a novice, and
      was raised to Accepted the same year as <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>
      and <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Verin">Verin Mathwin</a>,
      p. 57&mdash;Stout Aes Sedai
      of the Brown Ajah.  She is even shorter than
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, plump, and dreamy-eyed.
  <li><a class="name" name="Alanna">Alanna Mosvani</a>,
      p. 59&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.  She is shy, but she works hard at being fierce.  She wants to
      be a Green and have a dozen Warders.  She is always exaggerating.  At
      the meeting where <a href="#Tamra">Tamra</a> announced her plan for the
      bounty, she asked if the Accepted would be allowed to defend themselves
      with the One Power.  The answer was no.

      p. 75&mdash;Accepted from
      Tarabon.  She is the most beautiful woman in the Accepted's quarters,
      with the possible exception of <a href="#Ellid">Ellid</a>, though she
      seems blissfully unaware of this.  She has very little tact for a
      sheepherder's daughter, and a sharp tongue.  She is often unaware when
      she says something wrong.  She and <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> are
      friends.
  <li><a class="name" name="Ellid">Ellid Abareim</a>,
      p. 75&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.  She is one of the two prettiest girls in the Accepted's
      quarters, and she is very aware of that fact.  She always smiles when
      looking in a mirror, and always seems to be near to a mirror when she
      smiles.  Waves of golden hair frame her nearly perfect face, her eyes
      look like large sapphires, and her skin is a rich creamy color.  The
      only fault in her appearance, according to
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, is an over-abundance of bosom.  She
      is very tall, as tall as most men.  She is fond of telling everyone that
      she wants to be a Green and have six Warders.  She has spiky
      handwriting.
